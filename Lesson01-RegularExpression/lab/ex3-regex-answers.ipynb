Watson, M.D., late of the Army Medical Department.)      CHAPTER I Mr. Sherlock Holmes   In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.  The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.  Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.  I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.  On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.  \"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\" he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. \"You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\"  I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.  \"Poor devil!\" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. \"What are you up to now?\"  \"Looking for lodgings,\" I answered. \"Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\"  \"That's a strange thing,\" remarked my companion; \"you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.\"  \"And who was the first?\" I asked.  \"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for his purse.\"  \"By Jove!\" I cried, \"if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone.\"  Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \"You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,\" he said; \"perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion.\"  \"Why, what is there against him?\"  \"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a decent fellow enough.\"  \"A medical student, I suppose?\" said I.  \"No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors.\"  \"Did you never ask him what he was going in for?\" I asked.  \"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\"  \"I should like to meet him,\" I said. \"If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?\"  \"He is sure to be at the laboratory,\" returned my companion. \"He either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\"  \"Certainly,\" I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.  As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.  \"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,\" he said; \"I know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.\"  \"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,\" I answered. \"It seems to me, Stamford,\" I added, looking hard at my companion, \"that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it.\"  \"It is not easy to express the inexpressible,\" he answered with a laugh. \"Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.\"  \"Very right too.\"  \"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.\"  \"Beating the subjects!\"  \"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it with my own eyes.\"  \"And yet you say he is not a medical student?\"  \"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.\" As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.  This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I've found it! I've found it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.  \"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.  \"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.\"  \"How on earth did you know that?\" I asked in astonishment.  \"Never mind,\" said he, chuckling to himself. \"The question now is about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?\"  \"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but practically--\"  \"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working. \"Let us have some fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \"Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\" As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.  \"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"  \"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.  \"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"  \"Indeed!\" I murmured.  \"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\"  His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.  \"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at his enthusiasm.  \"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.\"  \"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\" said Stamford with a laugh. \"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police News of the Past.'\"  \"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. \"I have to be careful,\" he continued, turning to me with a smile, \"for I dabble with poisons a good deal.\" He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.  \"We came here on business,\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. \"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.\"  Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. \"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\" he said, \"which would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?\"  \"I always smoke 'ship's' myself,\" I answered.  \"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?\"  \"By no means.\"  \"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.\"  I laughed at this cross-examination. \"I keep a bull pup,\" I said, \"and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.\"  \"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\" he asked, anxiously.  \"It depends on the player,\" I answered. \"A well-played violin is a treat for the gods--a badly-played one--\"  \"Oh, that's all right,\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \"I think we may consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.\"  \"When shall we see them?\"  \"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle everything,\" he answered.  \"All right--noon exactly,\" said I, shaking his hand.  We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel.  \"By the way,\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, \"how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\"  My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \"That's just his little peculiarity,\" he said. \"A good many people have wanted to know how he finds things out.\"  \"Oh! a mystery is it?\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \"This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper study of mankind is man,' you know.\"  \"You must study him, then,\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. \"You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more about you than you about him. Good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye,\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance.      CHAPTER II The Science Of Deduction   We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221b, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.  Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.  As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.  The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.  He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so.  His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.  \"You appear to be astonished,\" he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. \"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\"  \"To forget it!\"  \"You see,\" he explained, \"I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.\"  \"But the Solar System!\" I protested.  \"What the deuce is it to me?\" he interrupted impatiently; \"you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\"  I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way--  Sherlock Holmes--his limits.  1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil. 2. Philosophy.--Nil. 3. Astronomy.--Nil. 4. Politics.--Feeble. 5. Botany.--Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening. 6. Geology.--Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. After walks has shown me splashes upon his trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he had received them. 7. Chemistry.--Profound. 8. Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic. 9. Sensational Literature.--Immense. He appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century. 10. Plays the violin well. 11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman. 12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.  When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. \"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\" I said to myself, \"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\"  I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.  During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slipshod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \"I have to use this room as a place of business,\" he said, \"and these people are my clients.\" Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord.  It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.  Its somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.  \"From a drop of water,\" said the writer, \"a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man's finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\"  \"What ineffable twaddle!\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, \"I never read such rubbish in my life.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.  \"Why, this article,\" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast. \"I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\"  \"You would lose your money,\" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly.  \"As for the article I wrote it myself.\"  \"You!\"  \"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.\"  \"And how?\" I asked involuntarily.  \"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\"  \"And these other people?\"  \"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.\"  \"But do you mean to say,\" I said, \"that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?\"  \"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\"  \"You were told, no doubt.\"  \"Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\"  \"It is simple enough as you explain it,\" I said, smiling. \"You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.\"  Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \"No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\" he observed. \"Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\"  \"Have you read Gaboriau's works?\" I asked. \"Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?\"  Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \"Lecoq was a miserable bungler,\" he said, in an angry voice; \"he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.\"  I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. \"This fellow may be very clever,\" I said to myself, \"but he is certainly very conceited.\"  \"There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\" he said, querulously. \"What is the use of having brains in our profession? I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villany with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.\"  I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic.  \"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?\" I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.  \"You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"Brag and bounce!\" thought I to myself. \"He knows that I cannot verify his guess.\"  The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair.  \"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.  Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot. \"May I ask, my lad,\" I said, in the blandest voice, \"what your trade may be?\"  \"Commissionaire, sir,\" he said, gruffly. \"Uniform away for repairs.\"  \"And you were?\" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.  \"A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.\"  He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.      CHAPTER III The Lauriston Garden Mystery   I confess that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his powers of analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.  \"How in the world did you deduce that?\" I asked.  \"Deduce what?\" said he, petulantly.  \"Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\"  \"I have no time for trifles,\" he answered, brusquely; then with a smile, \"Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?\"  \"No, indeed.\"  \"It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\"  \"Wonderful!\" I ejaculated.  \"Commonplace,\" said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \"I said just now that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!\" He threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.  \"Why,\" I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \"this is terrible!\"  \"It does seem to be a little out of the common,\" he remarked, calmly. \"Would you mind reading it to me aloud?\"  This is the letter which I read to him--  \"My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes: \"There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.' There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything in statu quo until I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion. \"Yours faithfully, \"Tobias Gregson.\"  \"Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\" my friend remarked; \"he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent.\"  I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \"Surely there is not a moment to be lost,\" I cried, \"shall I go and order you a cab?\"  \"I'm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be spry enough at times.\"  \"Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\"  \"My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the whole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\"  \"But he begs you to help him.\"  \"Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\"  He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.  \"Get your hat,\" he said.  \"You wish me to come?\"  \"Yes, if you have nothing better to do.\" A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.  It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.  \"You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\" I said at last, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.  \"No data yet,\" he answered. \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\"  \"You will have your data soon,\" I remarked, pointing with my finger; \"this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.\"  \"So it is. Stop, driver, stop!\" We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot.  Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a \"To Let\" card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.  I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.  At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion's hand with effusion. \"It is indeed kind of you to come,\" he said, \"I have had everything left untouched.\"  \"Except that!\" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \"If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.\"  \"I have had so much to do inside the house,\" the detective said evasively. \"My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.\"  Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \"With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,\" he said.  Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \"I think we have done all that can be done,\" he answered; \"it's a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things.\"  \"You did not come here in a cab?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.  \"No, sir.\"  \"Nor Lestrade?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Then let us go and look at the room.\" With which inconsequent remark he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his astonishment.  A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires.  It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.  All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.  Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.  \"This case will make a stir, sir,\" he remarked. \"It beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.\"  \"There is no clue?\" said Gregson.  \"None at all,\" chimed in Lestrade.  Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. \"You are sure that there is no wound?\" he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.  \"Positive!\" cried both detectives.  \"Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.\"  As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted.\n"

       "' by the same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss Morstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father?\"  \"Nothing could be more unlike.\"  \"I expected to hear you say so. We shall look out for you, then, at six. Pray allow me to keep the papers. I may look into the matter before then. It is only half-past three. Au revoir, then.\"  \"Au revoir,\" said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from one to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away. Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly down the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd.  \"What a very attractive woman!\" I exclaimed, turning to my companion.  He had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids. \"Is she?\" he said, languidly. \"I did not observe.\"  \"You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!\" I cried. \"There is something positively inhuman in you at times.\"  He smiled gently. \"It is of the first importance,\" he said, \"not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities. A client is to me a mere unit,--a factor in a problem. The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning. I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor.\"  \"In this case, however--\"  \"I never make exceptions. An exception disproves the rule. Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting? What do you make of this fellow\\'s scribble?\"  \"It is legible and regular,\" I answered. \"A man of business habits and some force of character.\"  Holmes shook his head. \"Look at his long letters,\" he said. \"They hardly rise above the common herd. That d might be an a, and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however illegibly they may write. There is vacillation in his k\\'s and self-esteem in his capitals. I am going out now. I have some few references to make. Let me recommend this book,--one of the most remarkable ever penned. It is Winwood Reade\\'s Martyrdom of Man. I shall be back in an hour.\"  I sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer. My mind ran upon our late visitor,--her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the strange mystery which overhung her life. If she were seventeen at the time of her father\\'s disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,--a sweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience. So I sat and mused, until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology. What was I, an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should dare to think of such things? She was a unit, a factor,--nothing more. If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o\\'-the-wisps of the imagination.      CHAPTER III In Quest of a Solution   It was half-past five before Holmes returned. He was bright, eager, and in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression.  \"There is no great mystery in this matter,\" he said, taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him. \"The facts appear to admit of only one explanation.\"  \"What! you have solved it already?\"  \"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive fact, that is all. It is, however, very suggestive. The details are still to be added. I have just found, on consulting the back files of the Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay Infantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\"  \"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\"  \"No? You surprise me. Look at it in this way, then. Captain Morstan disappears. The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto. Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London. Four years later Sholto dies. Within a week of his death Captain Morstan\\'s daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from year to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman. What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto\\'s death, unless it is that Sholto\\'s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts?\"  \"But what a strange compensation! And how strangely made! Why, too, should he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the letter speaks of giving her justice. What justice can she have? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive. There is no other injustice in her case that you know of.\"  \"There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\" said Sherlock Holmes, pensively. \"But our expedition of to-night will solve them all. Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside. Are you all ready? Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the hour.\"  I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It was clear that he thought that our night\\'s work might be a serious one.  Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was composed, but pale. She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.  \"Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa\\'s,\" she said. \"His letters were full of allusions to the major. He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a great deal together. By the way, a curious paper was found in papa\\'s desk which no one could understand. I don\\'t suppose that it is of the slightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I brought it with me. It is here.\"  Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee. He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.  \"It is paper of native Indian manufacture,\" he remarked. \"It has at some time been pinned to a board. The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it is \\'3.37 from left,\\' in faded pencil-writing.  In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters, \\'The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.\\' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance. It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\"  \"It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\"  \"Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of use to us. I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my ideas.\" He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently. Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey.  It was a September evening, and not yet seven o\\'clock, but the day had been a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city. Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets. Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement. The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and threw a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare. There was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom once more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy evening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined to make me nervous and depressed. I could see from Miss Morstan\\'s manner that she was suffering from the same feeling. Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences. He held his open note-book upon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.  At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances. In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women. We had hardly reached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small, dark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.  \"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\" he asked.  \"I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\" said she.  He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us. \"You will excuse me, miss,\" he said with a certain dogged manner, \"but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer.\"  \"I give you my word on that,\" she answered.  He gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door. The man who had addressed us mounted to the box, while we took our places inside. We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets.  The situation was a curious one. We were driving to an unknown place, on an unknown errand. Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey. Miss Morstan\\'s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever. I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved. To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it. At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what with our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost my bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very long way. Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets.  \"Rochester Row,\" said he. \"Now Vincent Square. Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road. We are making for the Surrey side, apparently. Yes, I thought so. Now we are on the bridge. You can catch glimpses of the river.\"  We did indeed bet a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.  \"Wordsworth Road,\" said my companion. \"Priory Road. Lark Hall Lane. Stockwell Place. Robert Street. Cold Harbor Lane. Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions.\"  We had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood. Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner. Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,--the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country. At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace. None of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window. On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting clothes, and a yellow sash. There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house.  \"The Sahib awaits you,\" said he, and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room. \"Show them in to me, khitmutgar,\" it cried. \"Show them straight in to me.\"      CHAPTER IV The Story of the Bald-Headed Man   We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year.  \"Your servant, Miss Morstan,\" he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice. \"Your servant, gentlemen. Pray step into my little sanctum. A small place, miss, but furnished to my own liking.  An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London.\"  We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odor.  \"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\" said the little man, still jerking and smiling. \"That is my name. You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these gentlemen--\"  \"This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\"  \"A doctor, eh?\" cried he, much excited. \"Have you your stethoscope? Might I ask you--would you have the kindness? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve, if you would be so very good. The aortic I may rely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\"  I listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything amiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered from head to foot. \"It appears to be normal,\" I said. \"You have no cause for uneasiness.\"  \"You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\" he remarked, airily.  \"I am a great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve. I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted. Had your father, Miss Morstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have been alive now.\"  I could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter. Miss Morstan sat down, and her face grew white to the lips. \"I knew in my heart that he was dead,\" said she.  \"I can give you every information,\" said he, \"and, what is more, I can do you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say. I am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you, but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say. The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew. But let us have no outsiders,--no police or officials. We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference. Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\" He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery blue eyes.  \"For my part,\" said Holmes, \"whatever you may choose to say will go no further.\"  I nodded to show my agreement.  \"That is well! That is well!\" said he. \"May I offer you a glass of Chianti, Miss Morstan? Or of Tokay? I keep no other wines. Shall I open a flask? No? Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco. I am a little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\" He applied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water. We sat all three in a semicircle, with our heads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky little fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the centre.  \"When I first determined to make this communication to you,\" said he, \"I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman. I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my weakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern French school.\"  \"You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\" said Miss Morstan, \"but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me. It is very late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible.\"  \"At the best it must take some time,\" he answered; \"for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew. We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew. He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me. I had quite high words with him last night. You cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry.\"  \"If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once,\" I ventured to remark.  He laughed until his ears were quite red. \"That would hardly do,\" he cried. \"I don\\'t know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way. No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant. I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself.  \"My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian army. He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, and brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.  \"I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan. We read the details in the papers, and, knowing that he had been a friend of our father\\'s, we discussed the case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,--that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.  \"We did know, however, that some mystery--some positive danger--overhung our father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge. Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them. He was once light-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father\\'s, but events have since led us to change our opinion.  \"Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us.  \"When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily. He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed. Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement to us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain. I shall try and give it to you in his own very words.  \"\\'I have only one thing,\\' he said, \\'which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan\\'s orphan. The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet I have made no use of it myself,--so blind and foolish a thing is avarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her. You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But send her nothing--not even the chaplet--until I am gone. After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered.  \"\\'I will tell you how Morstan died,\\' he continued. \\'He had suffered for years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one. I alone knew it. When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan\\'s arrival he came straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from the station, and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar, who is now dead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest. When I stooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead.  \"\\'For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do. My first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could not but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder. His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know.  \"\\'I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my servant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway. He stole in and bolted the door behind him. \"Do not fear, Sahib,\" he said. \"No one need know that you have killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\" \"I did not kill him,\" said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. \"I heard it all, Sahib,\" said he. \"I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him away together.\" That was enough to decide met. If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure, and that I have clung to Morstan\\'s share as well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution. Put your ears down to my mouth. The treasure is hidden in--At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled, in a voice which I can never forget, \\'Keep him out! For Christ\\'s sake keep him out\\'! We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat.  \"We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder, save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father\\'s room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words \\'The sign of the four\\' scrawled across it. What the phrase meant, or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge, none of my father\\'s property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it is still a complete mystery to us.\"  The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father\\'s death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint. She rallied however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced, and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe.  \"My brother and I,\" said he, \"were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without discovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father\\'s fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan\\'s address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.\"  \"It was a kindly thought,\" said our companion, earnestly. \"It was extremely good of you.\"  The little man waved his hand deprecatingly. \"We were your trustees,\" he said. \"That was the view which I took of it, though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty of money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. \\'Le mauvais goÃ»t mÃ¨ne au crime.\\' The French have a very neat way of putting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself: so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me. Yesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew: so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\"  Mr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee. We all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken. Holmes was the first to spring to his feet.  \"You have done well, sir, from first to last,\" said he. \"It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you. But, as Miss Morstan remarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through without delay.\"  Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs. This he buttoned tightly up, in spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face. \"My health is somewhat fragile,\" he remarked, as he led the way down the passage. \"I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.\"  Our cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently prearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace. Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels.  \"Bartholomew is a clever fellow,\" said he. \"How do you think he found out where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors: so he worked out all the cubic space of the house, and made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These could only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest, resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling.\"  At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.  \"This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\" said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, as he handed her out.      CHAPTER V The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge   It was nearly eleven o\\'clock when we reached this final stage of our night\\'s adventures. We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us, and the night was fairly fine. A warm wind blew from the westward, and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts. It was clear enough to see for some distance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way.  Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass. A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.  \"Who is there?\" cried a gruff voice from within.  \"It is I, McMurdo. You surely know my knock by this time.\"  There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The door swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the opening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.  \"That you, Mr. Thaddeus? But who are the others? I had no orders about them from the master.\"  \"No, McMurdo? You surprise me! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends.  \"He ain\\'t been out o\\' his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no orders. You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let you in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\"  This was an unexpected obstacle. Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner. \"This is too bad of you, McMurdo!\" he said. \"If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young lady, too. She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\"  \"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\" said the porter, inexorably. \"Folk may be friends o\\' yours, and yet no friends o\\' the master\\'s. He pays me well to do my duty, and my duty I\\'ll do. I don\\'t know none o\\' your friends.\"  \"Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,\" cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. \"I don\\'t think you can have forgotten me. Don\\'t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison\\'s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back?\"  \"Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" roared the prize-fighter. \"God\\'s truth! how could I have mistook you? If instead o\\' standin\\' there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw, I\\'d ha\\' known you without a question. Ah, you\\'re one that has wasted your gifts, you have! You might have aimed high, if you had joined the fancy.\"  \"You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"Our friend won\\'t keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\"  \"In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends,\" he answered. \"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in.\"  Inside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window. The vast size of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a chill to the heart. Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand.  \"I cannot understand it,\" he said. \"There must be some mistake. I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no light in his window. I do not know what to make of it.\"  \"Does he always guard the premises in this way?\" asked Holmes.  \"Yes; he has followed my father\\'s custom. He was the favorite son, you know, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me. That is Bartholomew\\'s window up there where the moonshine strikes. It is quite bright, but there is no light from within, I think.\"  \"None,\" said Holmes. \"But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door.\"  \"Ah, that is the housekeeper\\'s room. That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits. She can tell us all about it. But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\"  He held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us. Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and we all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.  \"It is Mrs. Bernstone,\" said Sholto. \"She is the only woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment.\" He hurried for the door, and knocked in his peculiar way. We could see a tall old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.  \"Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come! I am so glad you have come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\" We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone.  Our guide had left us the lantern. Holmes swung it slowly round, and peered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds. Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand was in mine. A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other. I have marvelled at it since, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection. So we stood hand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us.  \"What a strange place!\" she said, looking round.  \"It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it. I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work.\"  \"And from the same cause,\" said Holmes. \"These are the traces of the treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.\"  At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.  \"There is something amiss with Bartholomew!\" he cried. \"I am frightened! My nerves cannot stand it.\" He was, indeed, half blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child.  \"Come into the house,\" said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.  \"Yes, do!\" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. \"I really do not feel equal to giving directions.\"  We all followed him into the housekeeper\\'s room, which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.  \"God bless your sweet calm face!\" she cried, with an hysterical sob. \"It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this day!\"  Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the others bloodless cheeks.  \"Master has locked himself in and will now answer me,\" she explained. \"All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,--you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such a face on him as that.\"  Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto\\'s teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were trembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.  The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.  \"There is something devilish in this, Watson,\" said he, more moved than I had ever before seen him. \"What do you make of it?\"  I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very face of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance. The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.  \"This is terrible!\" I said to Holmes. \"What is to be done?\"  \"The door must come down,\" he answered, and, springing against it, he put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto\\'s chamber.  It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor. A set of steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.  By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold, and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced at it, and then handed it to me.  \"You see,\" he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.  In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \"The sign of the four.\"  \"In God\\'s name, what does it all mean?\" I asked.  \"It means murder,\" said he, stooping over the dead man. \"Ah, I expected it. Look here!\" He pointed to what looked like a long, dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.  \"It looks like a thorn,\" said I.  \"It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is poisoned.\"  I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been.  \"This is all an insoluble mystery to me,\" said I. \"It grows darker instead of clearer.\"  \"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it clears every instant. I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\"  We had almost forgotten our companion\\'s presence since we entered the chamber. He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however, he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.  \"The treasure is gone!\" he said. \"They have robbed him of the treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him to do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last night, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs.\"  \"What time was that?\"  \"It was ten o\\'clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall. But you don\\'t think so, gentlemen? Surely you don\\'t think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!\" He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.  \"You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes, kindly, putting his hand upon his shoulder. \"Take my advice, and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist them in every way. We shall wait here until your return.\"  The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark.      CHAPTER VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration   \"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \"we have half an hour to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something deeper underlying it.\"  \"Simple!\" I ejaculated.  \"Surely,\" said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class. \"Just sit in the corner there, that your footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not been opened since last night. How of the window?\" He carried the lamp across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but addressing them to himself rather than to me. \"Window is snibbed on the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration.\"  I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. \"This is not a footmark,\" said I.  \"It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.\"  \"It is the wooden-legged man.\"  \"Quite so. But there has been some one else,--a very able and efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?\"  I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work.  \"It is absolutely impossible,\" I answered.  \"Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you were an active man, you might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor point it may be noted,\" he continued, fingering the rope, \"that our wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand.\"  \"This is all very well,\" said I, \"but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he into the room?\"  \"Yes, the ally!\" repeated Holmes, pensively. \"There are features of interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselves from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.\"  \"How came he, then?\" I reiterated. \"The door is locked, the window is inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?\"  \"The grate is much too small,\" he answered. \"I had already considered that possibility.\"  \"How then?\" I persisted.  \"You will not apply my precept,\" he said, shaking his head. \"How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\"  \"He came through the hole in the roof,\" I cried.  \"Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room above,--the secret room in which the treasure was found.\"  He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him.  The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.  \"Here you are, you see,\" said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against the sloping wall. \"This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One entered. Let us see if we can find one other traces of his individuality.\"  He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face. For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes. The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,--clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man.  \"Holmes,\" I said, in a whisper, \"a child has done the horrid thing.\"  He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. \"I was staggered for the moment,\" he said, \"but the thing is quite natural. My memory failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down.\"  \"What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\" I asked, eagerly, when we had regained the lower room once more.  \"My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\" said he, with a touch of impatience. \"You know my methods. Apply them, and it will be instructive to compare results.\"  \"I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\" I answered.  \"It will be clear enough to you soon,\" he said, in an off-hand way. \"I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.\" He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and furtive were his movements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of exerting them in its defense. As he hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.  \"We are certainly in luck,\" said he. \"We ought to have very little trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked, You see, and the stuff has leaked out.\"  \"What then?\" I asked.  \"Why, we have got him, that\\'s all,\" said he. \"I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world\\'s end. If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three. The answer should give us the--But halloo! here are the accredited representatives of the law.\"  Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below, and the hall door shut with a loud crash.  \"Before they come,\" said Holmes, \"just put your hand here on this poor fellow\\'s arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?\"  \"The muscles are as hard as a board,\" I answered.  \"Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding the usual rigor mortis. Coupled with this distortion of the face, this Hippocratic smile, or \\'risus sardonicus,\\' as the old writers called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\"  \"Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,\" I answered,--\"some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.\"  \"That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair. Now examine the thorn.\"  I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife.  \"Is that an English thorn?\" he asked.  \"No, it certainly is not.\"  \"With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference. But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.\"  As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.  \"Here\\'s a business!\" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. \"Here\\'s a pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren!\"  \"I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\" said Holmes, quietly.  \"Why, of course I do!\" he wheezed. \"It\\'s Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the theorist. Remember you! I\\'ll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It\\'s true you set us on the right track; but you\\'ll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance.\"  \"It was a piece of very simple reasoning.\"  \"Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all this? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,--no room for theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d\\'you think the man died of?\"  \"Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over,\" said Holmes, dryly.  \"No, no. Still, we can\\'t deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a million missing. How was the window?\"  \"Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.\"  \"Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter. That\\'s common sense. Man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto. Your friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure. How\\'s that?\"  \"On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside.\"  \"Hum! There\\'s a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter. This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother; there was a quarrel; so much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much also we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him. His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind. His appearance is--well, not attractive. You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus. The net begins to close upon him.\"  \"You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\" said Holmes. \"This splinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned, was in the man\\'s scalp where you still see the mark; this card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit into your theory?\"  \"Confirms it in every respect,\" said the fat detective, pompously. \"House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some hocus-pocus,--a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how did he depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof.\" With great activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door.  \"He can find something,\" remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders. \"He has occasional glimmerings of reason. Il n\\'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l\\'esprit!\"  \"You see!\" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again. \"Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case is confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it is partly open.\"  \"It was I who opened it.\"  \"Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?\" He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery. \"Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our gentleman got away. Inspector!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" from the passage.  \"Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.--Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you. I arrest you in the Queen\\'s name as being concerned in the death of your brother.\"  \"There, now! Didn\\'t I tell you!\" cried the poor little man, throwing out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.  \"Don\\'t trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes. \"I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge.\"  \"Don\\'t promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don\\'t promise too much!\" snapped the detective. \"You may find it a harder matter than you think.\"  \"Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man--\"  \"Ah! the other man--?\" asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the other\\'s manner.  \"Is a rather curious person,\" said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his heel. \"I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them. A word with you, Watson.\"  He led me out to the head of the stair. \"This unexpected occurrence,\" he said, \"has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey.\"  \"I have just been thinking so,\" I answered. \"It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house.\"  \"No. You must escort her home. She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester, in Lower Camberwell: so it is not very far. I will wait for you here if you will drive out again. Or perhaps you are too tired?\"  \"By no means. I don\\'t think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business. I have seen something of the rough side of life, but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely. I should like, however, to see the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.\"  \"Your presence will be of great service to me,\" he answered. \"We shall work the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare\\'s-nest which he may choose to construct. When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down near the water\\'s edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer\\'s: Sherman is the name. You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window. Knock old Sherman up, and tell him, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once. You will bring Toby back in the cab with you.\"  \"A dog, I suppose.\"  \"Yes,--a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent. I would rather have Toby\\'s help than that of the whole detective force of London.\"  \"I shall bring him, then,\" said I. \"It is one now. I ought to be back before three, if I can get a fresh horse.\"  \"And I,\" said Holmes, \"shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the next garret. Then I shall study the great Jones\\'s methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms. \\'Wir sind gewohnt, daÃŸ die Menschen verhÃ¶hnen was sie nicht verstehen.\\' Goethe is always pithy.\"      CHAPTER VII The Episode of the Barrel   The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worse still, she was rich. If Holmes\\'s researches were successful, she would be an heiress. Was it fair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind. This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us.  It was nearly two o\\'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester\\'s. The servants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return. She opened the door herself, a middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other\\'s waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an honored friend. I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures. I explained, however, the importance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case. As we drove away I stole a glance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the two graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall light shining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright stair-rods. It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had absorbed us.  And the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it grew. I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets. There was the original problem: that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain Morstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,--we had had light upon all those events. They had only led us, however, to a deeper and far more tragic mystery. The Indian treasure, the curious plan found among Morstan\\'s baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto\\'s death, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the crime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card, corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan\\'s chart,--here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.  Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth. I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I could make my impression. At last, however, there was the glint of a candle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.  \"Go on, you drunken vagabone,\" said the face. \"If you kick up any more row I\\'ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\"  \"If you\\'ll let one out it\\'s just what I have come for,\" said I.  \"Go on!\" yelled the voice. \"So help me gracious, I have a wiper in the bag, an\\' I\\'ll drop it on your \\'ead if you don\\'t hook it.\"  \"But I want a dog,\" I cried.  \"I won\\'t be argued with!\" shouted Mr. Sherman. \"Now stand clear, for when I say \\'three,\\' down goes the wiper.\"  \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes--\" I began, but the words had a most magical effect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the door was unbarred and open. Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man, with stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.  \"A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\" said he.  \"Step in, sir. Keep clear of the badger; for he bites. Ah, naughty, naughty, would you take a nip at the gentleman?\" This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage. \"Don\\'t mind that, sir: it\\'s only a slow-worm. It hain\\'t got no fangs, so I gives it the run o\\' the room, for it keeps the bettles down. You must not mind my bein\\' just a little short wi\\' you at first, for I\\'m guyed at by the children, and there\\'s many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up. What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\"  \"He wanted a dog of yours.\"  \"Ah! that would be Toby.\"  \"Yes, Toby was the name.\"  \"Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\" He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him. In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls, who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers.  Toby proved to an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel and half lurcher, brown-and-white in color, with a very clumsy waddling gait. It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it followed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me. It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge. The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station. Two constables guarded the narrow gate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective\\'s name.  Holmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets, smoking his pipe.  \"Ah, you have him there!\" said he. \"Good dog, then! Athelney Jones has gone. We have had an immense display of energy since you left. He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper, and the Indian servant. We have the place to ourselves, but for a sergeant up-stairs. Leave the dog here, and come up.\"  We tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs. The room was as we had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure. A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.  \"Lend me your bull\\'s-eye, sergeant,\" said my companion. \"Now tie this bit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you. Now I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them down with you, Watson. I am going to do a little climbing. And dip my handkerchief into the creasote. That will do. Now come up into the garret with me for a moment.\"  We clambered up through the hole. Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust.  \"I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\" he said. \"Do you observe anything noteworthy about them?\"  \"They belong,\" I said, \"to a child or a small woman.\"  \"Apart from their size, though. Is there nothing else?\"  \"They appear to be much as other footmarks.\"  \"Not at all. Look here! This is the print of a right foot in the dust. Now I make one with my naked foot beside it. What is the chief difference?\"  \"Your toes are all cramped together. The other print has each toe distinctly divided.\"  \"Quite so. That is the point. Bear that in mind. Now, would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work? I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\"  I did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell.  \"That is where he put his foot in getting out. If you can trace him, I should think that Toby will have no difficulty. Now run down-stairs, loose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\"  By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge. I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon the opposite side. When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves.  \"That You, Watson?\" he cried.  \"Yes.\"  \"This is the place. What is that black thing down there?\"  \"A water-barrel.\"  \"Top on it?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"No sign of a ladder?\"  \"No.\"  \"Confound the fellow! It\\'s a most break-neck place. I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up. The water-pipe feels pretty firm. Here goes, anyhow.\"  There was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall. Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel, and from there to the earth.  \"It was easy to follow him,\" he said, drawing on his stockings and boots. \"Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he had dropped this. It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\"  The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it. In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other, like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.  \"They are hellish things,\" said he. \"Look out that you don\\'t prick yourself. I\\'m delighted to have them, for the chances are that they are all he has. There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long. I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself. Are you game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?\"  \"Certainly,\" I answered.  \"Your leg will stand it?\"  \"Oh, yes.\"  \"Here you are, doggy! Good old Toby! Smell it, Toby, smell it!\" He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog\\'s nose, while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical cock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage. Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a stout cord to the mongrel\\'s collar, and let him to the foot of the water-barrel. The creature instantly broke into a succession of high, tremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the air, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed.  The east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light. The square, massive house, with its black, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn, behind us. Our course let right across the grounds, in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected. The whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs, had a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it.  On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly, underneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech. Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been loosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder. Holmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over upon the other side.  \"There\\'s the print of wooden-leg\\'s hand,\" he remarked, as I mounted up beside him. \"You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster. What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours\\' start.\"  I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval. My fears were soon appeased, however. Toby never hesitated or swerved, but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion. Clearly, the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.  \"Do not imagine,\" said Holmes, \"that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical. I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways. This, however, is the readiest and, since fortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected it. It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There might have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too palpable clue.\"  \"There is credit, and to spare,\" said I. \"I assure you, Holmes, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable. How, for example, could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man?\"  \"Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself. I don\\'t wish to be theatrical. It is all patent and above-board. Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure. A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan\\'s possession. He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates,--the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called it. Aided by this chart, the officers--or one of them--gets the treasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some condition under which he received it unfulfilled. Now, then, why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself? The answer is obvious. The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts. Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away.\"  \"But that is mere speculation,\" said I.  \"It is more than that. It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts. Let us see how it fits in with the sequel. Major Sholto remains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his treasure. Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright. What was that?\"  \"A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\"  \"Or had escaped. That is much more likely, for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was. It would not have been a surprise to him. What does he do then? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man,--a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white tradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him. Now, only one white man\\'s name is on the chart. The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans. There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small. Does the reasoning strike yo as being faulty?\"  \"No: it is clear and concise.\"  \"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us look at it from his point of view. He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him. He found out where Sholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house. There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not seen. Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could not find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever knew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died. Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed. In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the guards, makes his way to the dying man\\'s window, and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons. Mad with hate, however, against the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure, and finally leaves a memento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card. He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view of the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice. Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal. Do you follow all this?\"  \"Very clearly.\"  \"Now, what could Jonathan Small do? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the discovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it. We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household. Jonathan, with his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto. He takes with him, however, a rather curious associate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into creasote, whence come Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis.\"  \"But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\"  \"Quite so. And rather to Jonathan\\'s disgust, to judge by the way the stamped about when he got into the room. He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged. He did not wish to put his head in a halter. There was no help for it, however: the savage instincts of his companion had broken out, and the poison had done its work: so Jonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground, and followed it himself. That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them. Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride, and we know that he was bearded. His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window. I don\\'t know that there is anything else.\"  \"The associate?\"  \"Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that. But you will know all about it soon enough. How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature! Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\"  \"Fairly so. I worked back to him through Carlyle.\"  \"That was like following the brook to the parent lake. He makes one curious but profound remark. It is that the chief proof of man\\'s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you see, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility. There is much food for thought in Richter. You have not a pistol, have you?\"  \"I have my stick.\"  \"It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair. Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead.\" He took out his revolver as he spoke, and, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket.  We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now, however, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where laborers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps. At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men were emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet. Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.  We had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval. The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of escaping observation. They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn. At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street. Where the latter street turns into Knight\\'s Place, Toby ceased to advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision. Then he waddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment.  \"What the deuce is the matter with the dog?\" growled Holmes. \"They surely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\"  \"Perhaps they stood here for some time,\" I suggested.  \"Ah! it\\'s all right. He\\'s off again,\" said my companion, in a tone of relief.  He was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown. The scent appeared to be much hotter than before, for he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run. I cold see by the gleam in Holmes\\'s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.  Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson\\'s large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the dog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work. On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage, between two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought. With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood upon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation. The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote.  Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.      CHAPTER VIII The Baker Street Irregulars   \"What now?\" I asked. \"Toby has lost his character for infallibility.\"  \"He acted according to his lights,\" said Holmes, lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard. \"If you consider how much creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame.\"  \"We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\"  \"Yes. And, fortunately, we have no distance to go. Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight\\'s Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one. It only remains to follow the other.\"  There was no difficulty about this. On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction.  \"We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote-barrel came from,\" I observed.  \"I had thought of that. But you notice that he keeps on the pavement, whereas the barrel passed down the roadway. No, we are on the true scent now.\"  It tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place and Prince\\'s Street. At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water\\'s edge, where there was a small wooden wharf. Toby led us to the very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond.  \"We are out of luck,\" said Holmes. \"They have taken to a boat here.\" Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf. We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he sniffed earnestly, he made no sign.  Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. \"Mordecai Smith\" was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, \"Boats to hire by the hour or day.\" A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept,--a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression.  \"This looks bad,\" said he. \"These fellows are sharper than I expected. They seem to have covered their tracks. There has, I fear, been preconcerted management here.\"  He was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little, curly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish, red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.  \"You come back and be washed, Jack,\" she shouted. \"Come back, you young imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he\\'ll let us hear of it.\"  \"Dear little chap!\" said Holmes, strategically. \"What a rosy-cheeked young rascal! Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?\"  The youth pondered for a moment. \"I\\'d like a shillin\\',\" said he.  \"Nothing you would like better?\"  \"I\\'d like two shillin\\' better,\" the prodigy answered, after some thought.  \"Here you are, then! Catch!--A fine child, Mrs. Smith!\"  \"Lor\\' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward. He gets a\\'most too much for me to manage, \\'specially when my man is away days at a time.\"  \"Away, is he?\" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice. \"I am sorry for that, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\"  \"He\\'s been away since yesterday mornin\\', sir, and, truth to tell, I am beginnin\\' to feel frightened about him. But if it was about a boat, sir, maybe I could serve as well.\"  \"I wanted to hire his steam launch.\"  \"Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone. That\\'s what puzzles me; for I know there ain\\'t more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back. If he\\'d been away in the barge I\\'d ha\\' thought nothin\\'; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin\\' there he might ha\\' stayed over. But what good is a steam launch without coals?\"  \"He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\"  \"He might, sir, but it weren\\'t his way. Many a time I\\'ve heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don\\'t like that wooden-legged man, wi\\' his ugly face and outlandish talk. What did he want always knockin\\' about here for?\"  \"A wooden-legged man?\" said Holmes, with bland surprise.  \"Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that\\'s called more\\'n once for my old man. It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what\\'s more, my man knew he was comin\\', for he had steam up in the launch. I tell you straight, sir, I don\\'t feel easy in my mind about it.\"  \"But, my dear Mrs. Smith,\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \"You are frightening yourself about nothing. How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night? I don\\'t quite understand how you can be so sure.\"  \"His voice, sir. I knew his voice, which is kind o\\' thick and foggy. He tapped at the winder,--about three it would be. \\'Show a leg, matey,\\' says he: \\'time to turn out guard.\\' My old man woke up Jim,--that\\'s my eldest,--and away they went, without so much as a word to me. I could hear the wooden leg clackin\\' on the stones.\"  \"And was this wooden-legged man alone?\"  \"Couldn\\'t say, I am sure, sir. I didn\\'t hear no one else.\"  \"I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard good reports of the--Let me see, what is her name?\"  \"The Aurora, sir.\"  \"Ah! She\\'s not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in the beam?\"  \"No, indeed. She\\'s as trim a little thing as any on the river. She\\'s been fresh painted, black with two red streaks.\"  \"Thanks. I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith. I am going down the river; and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let him know that you are uneasy. A black funnel, you say?\"  \"No, sir. Black with a white band.\"  \"Ah, of course. It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs. Smith.--There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson. We shall take it and cross the river.  \"The main thing with people of that sort,\" said Holmes, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry, \"is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you. If you do, they will instantly shut up like an oyster. If you listen to them under protest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\"  \"Our course now seems pretty clear,\" said I.  \"What would you do, then?\"  \"I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the Aurora.\"  \"My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task. She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich. Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles. It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set about it alone.\"  \"Employ the police, then.\"  \"No. I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is not a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally. But I have a fancy for working it out myself, now that we have gone so far.\"  \"Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\"  \"Worse and worse! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels, and they would be off out of the country. As it is, they are likely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry. Jones\\'s energy will be of use to us there, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent.\"  \"What are we to do, then?\" I asked, as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary.  \"Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour\\'s sleep. It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again. Stop at a telegraph-office, cabby! We will keep Toby, for he may be of use to us yet.\"  We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes despatched his wire. \"Whom do you think that is to?\" he asked, as we resumed our journey.  \"I am sure I don\\'t know.\"  \"You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\"  \"Well,\" said I, laughing.  \"This is just the case where they might be invaluable. If they fail, I have other resources; but I shall try them first. That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\"  It was between eight and nine o\\'clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure, however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.  A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully. When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Holmes pouring out the coffee.  \"Here it is,\" said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper. \"The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them. But you have had enough of the case. Better have your ham and eggs first.\"  I took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed \"Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\"  \"About twelve o\\'clock last night,\" said the Standard, \"Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto\\'s person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station, and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones\\'s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\"  \"Isn\\'t it gorgeous!\" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. \"What do you think of it?\"  \"I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime.\"  \"So do I. I wouldn\\'t answer for our safety now, if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy.\"  At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay.  \"By heaven, Holmes,\" I said, half rising, \"I believe that they are really after us.\"  \"No, it\\'s not quite so bad as that. It is the unofficial force,--the Baker Street irregulars.\"  As he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street-Arabs. There was some show of discipline among them, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces. One of their number, taller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little carecrow.  \"Got your message, sir,\" said he, \"and brought \\'em on sharp. Three bob and a tanner for tickets.\"  \"Here you are,\" said Holmes, producing some silver. \"In future they can report to you, Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way. However, it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions. I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red streaks, funnel black with a white band. She is down the river somewhere. I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith\\'s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back. You must divide it out among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly. Let me know the moment you have news. Is that all clear?\"  \"Yes, guv\\'nor,\" said Wiggins.  \"The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat. Here\\'s a day in advance. Now off you go!\" He handed them a shilling each, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street.  \"If the launch is above water they will find her,\" said Holmes, as he rose from the table and lit his pipe. \"They can go everywhere, see everything, overhear every one. I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her. In the mean while, we can do nothing but await results. We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the Aurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\"  \"Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say. Are you going to bed, Holmes?\"  \"No: I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely. I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us. If ever man had an easy task, this of ours ought to be. Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man must, I should think, be absolutely unique.\"  \"That other man again!\"  \"I have no wish to make a mystery of him,--to you, anyway. But you must have formed your own opinion. Now, do consider the data. Diminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet, stone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts. What do you make of all this?\"  \"A savage!\" I exclaimed. \"Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small.\"  \"Hardly that,\" said he. \"When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views. Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as that. The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet. The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because the thong is commonly passed between. These little darts, too, could only be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe. Now, then, where are we to find our savage?\"  \"South American,\" I hazarded.  He stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf. \"This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published. It may be looked upon as the very latest authority. What have we here? \\'Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the Bay of Bengal.\\' Hum! hum!  What\\'s all this? Moist climate, coral reefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island, cottonwoods--Ah, here we are. \\'The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the Digger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians. The average height is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this. They are a fierce, morose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained.\\' Mark that, Watson. Now, then, listen to this. \\'They are naturally hideous, having large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted features. Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small. So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree. They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows. These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.\\' Nice, amiable people, Watson! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn. I fancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him.\"  \"But how came he to have so singular a companion?\"  \"Ah, that is more than I can tell. Since, however, we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him. No doubt we shall know all about it in time. Look here, Watson; you look regularly done. Lie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\"  He took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,--his own, no doubt, for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation. I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow. Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound, until I found myself in dream-land, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan looking down upon me.      CHAPTER IX A Break in the Chain   It was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed. Sherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me, as I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.  \"You have slept soundly,\" he said. \"I feared that our talk would wake you.\"  \"I heard nothing,\" I answered. \"Have you had fresh news, then?\"  \"Unfortunately, no. I confess that I am surprised and disappointed. I expected something definite by this time.  Wiggins has just been up to report. He says that no trace can be found of the launch. It is a provoking check, for every hour is of importance.\"  \"Can I do anything? I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for another night\\'s outing.\"  \"No, we can do nothing. We can only wait. If we go ourselves, the message might come in our absence, and delay be caused. You can do what you will, but I must remain on guard.\"  \"Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester. She asked me to, yesterday.\"  \"On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\" asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes.  \"Well, of course Miss Morstan too. They were anxious to hear what happened.\"  \"I would not tell them too much,\" said Holmes. \"Women are never to be entirely trusted,--not the best of them.\"  I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment. \"I shall be back in an hour or two,\" I remarked.  \"All right! Good luck! But, I say, if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby, for I don\\'t think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now.\"  I took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist\\'s in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night\\'s adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto\\'s death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them.  \"It is a romance!\" cried Mrs. Forrester. \"An injured lady, half a million in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian. They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\"  \"And two knight-errants to the rescue,\" added Miss Morstan, with a bright glance at me.  \"Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don\\'t think that you are nearly excited enough. Just imagine what it must be to be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\"  It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect. On the contrary, she gave a toss of her proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small interest.  \"It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\" she said. \"Nothing else is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout. It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge.\"  It was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I reached home. My companion\\'s book and pipe lay by his chair, but he had disappeared. I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but there was none.  \"I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\" I said to Mrs. Hudson as she came up to lower the blinds.  \"No, sir. He has gone to his room, sir. Do you know, sir,\" sinking her voice into an impressive whisper, \"I am afraid for his health?\"  \"Why so, Mrs. Hudson?\"  \"Well, he\\'s that strange, sir. After you was gone he walked and he walked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of his footstep. Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with \\'What is that, Mrs. Hudson?\\' And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can hear him walking away the same as ever. I hope he\\'s not going to be ill, sir. I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine, but he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don\\'t know how ever I got out of the room.\"  \"I don\\'t think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\" I answered. \"I have seen him like this before. He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless.\" I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread, and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction.  At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek.  \"You are knocking yourself up, old man,\" I remarked. \"I heard you marching about in the night.\"  \"No, I could not sleep,\" he answered. \"This infernal problem is consuming me. It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle, when all else had been overcome. I know the men, the launch, everything; and yet I can get no news. I have set other agencies at work, and used every means at my disposal. The whole river has been searched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband. I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft. But there are objections to that.\"  \"Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\"  \"No, I think that may be dismissed. I had inquiries made, and there is a launch of that description.\"  \"Could it have gone up the river?\"  \"I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party who will work up as far as Richmond. If no news comes to-day, I shall start off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat. But surely, surely, we shall hear something.\"  We did not, however. Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies. There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy. They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto. No fresh details were to be found, however, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day. I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose. He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.  In the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket, and a coarse red scarf round his neck.  \"I am off down the river, Watson,\" said he. \"I have been turning it over in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it. It is worth trying, at all events.\"  \"Surely I can come with you, then?\" said I.  \"No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative. I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent about it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to act on your own judgment if any news should come. Can I rely upon you?\"  \"Most certainly.\"  \"I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself. If I am in luck, however, I may not be gone so very long. I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back.\"  I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time. On opening the Standard, however, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business.  \"With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\" it remarked, \"we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter. He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, were both released yesterday evening. It is believed, however, that the police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his well-known energy and sagacity. Further arrests may be expected at any moment.\"  \"That is satisfactory so far as it goes,\" thought I. \"Friend Sholto is safe, at any rate. I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\"  I tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column. It ran in this way:  \"Lost.--Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith\\'s Wharf at or about three o\\'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white band, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith, at Smith\\'s Wharf, or at 221b Baker Street, as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora.\"  This was clearly Holmes\\'s doing. The Baker Street address was enough to prove that. It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband.  It was a long day. Every time that a knock came to the door, or a sharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement. I tried to read, but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered, some radical flaw in my companion\\'s reasoning. Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises? I had never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived. He was likely, I thought, to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic,--his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand. Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the evidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions. When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them trivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes\\'s explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outrÃ© and startling.  At three o\\'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an authoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person than Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me. Very different was he, however, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood. His expression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.  \"Good-day, sir; good-day,\" said he. \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I understand.\"  \"Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back. But perhaps you would care to wait. Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\"  \"Thank you; I don\\'t mind if I do,\" said he, mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief.  \"And a whiskey-and-soda?\"  \"Well, half a glass. It is very hot for the time of year; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me. You know my theory about this Norwood case?\"  \"I remember that you expressed one.\"  \"Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it. I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it. He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken. From the time that he left his brother\\'s room he was never out of sight of some one or other. So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors. It\\'s a very dark case, and my professional credit is at stake. I should be very glad of a little assistance.\"  \"We all need help sometimes,\" said I.  \"Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\" said he, in a husky and confidential voice. \"He\\'s a man who is not to be beat. I have known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon. He is irregular in his methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on the whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I don\\'t care who knows it. I have had a wire from him this morning, by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business. Here is the message.\"  He took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me. It was dated from Poplar at twelve o\\'clock. \"Go to Baker Street at once,\" it said. \"If I have not returned, wait for me. I am close on the track of the Sholto gang. You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish.\"  \"This sounds well. He has evidently picked up the scent again,\" said I.  \"Ah, then he has been at fault too,\" exclaimed Jones, with evident satisfaction. \"Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes. Of course this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at the door. Perhaps this is he.\"  A heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or twice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at last he made his way to our door and entered. His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard. He was an aged man, clad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat. His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing was painfully asthmatic. As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs. He had a colored scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray side-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.  \"What is it, my man?\" I asked.  He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.  \"Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\" said he.  \"No; but I am acting for him. You can tell me any message you have for him.\"  \"It was to him himself I was to tell it,\" said he.  \"But I tell you that I am acting for him. Was it about Mordecai Smith\\'s boat?\"  \"Yes. I knows well where it is. An\\' I knows where the men he is after are. An\\' I knows where the treasure is. I knows all about it.\"  \"Then tell me, and I shall let him know.\"  \"It was to him I was to tell it,\" he repeated, with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man.  \"Well, you must wait for him.\"  \"No, no; I ain\\'t goin\\' to lose a whole day to please no one. If Mr. Holmes ain\\'t here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself. I don\\'t care about the look of either of you, and I won\\'t tell a word.\"  He shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.  \"Wait a bit, my friend,\" said he. \"You have important information, and you must not walk off. We shall keep you, whether you like or not, until our friend returns.\"  The old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it, he recognized the uselessness of resistance.  \"Pretty sort o\\' treatment this!\" he cried, stamping his stick. \"I come here to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize me and treat me in this fashion!\"  \"You will be none the worse,\" I said. \"We shall recompense you for the loss of your time. Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have long to wait.\"  He came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face resting on his hands. Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk. Suddenly, however, Holmes\\'s voice broke in upon us.  \"I think that you might offer me a cigar too,\" he said.  We both started in our chairs. There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement.  \"Holmes!\" I exclaimed. \"You here! But where is the old man?\"  \"Here is the old man,\" said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \"Here he is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my disguise was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\"  \"Ah, you rogue!\" cried Jones, highly delighted. \"You would have made an actor, and a rare one. You had the proper workhouse cough, and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knew the glint of your eye, though. You didn\\'t get away from us so easily, you see.\"  \"I have been working in that get-up all day,\" said he, lighting his cigar. \"You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me,--especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases: so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this. You got my wire?\"  \"Yes; that was what brought me here.\"  \"How has your case prospered?\"  \"It has all come to nothing. I have had to release two of my prisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.\"  \"Never mind. We shall give you two others in the place of them. But you must put yourself under my orders. You are welcome to all the official credit, but you must act on the line that I point out. Is that agreed?\"  \"Entirely, if you will help me to the men.\"  \"Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat--a steam launch--to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o\\'clock.\"  \"That is easily managed. There is always one about there; but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure.\"  \"Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.\"  \"There will be two or three in the boat. What else?\"  \"When we secure the men we shall get the treasure. I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs. Let her be the first to open it.--Eh, Watson?\"  \"It would be a great pleasure to me.\"  \"Rather an irregular proceeding,\" said Jones, shaking his head. \"However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at it. The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation.\"  \"Certainly. That is easily managed. One other point. I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself. You know I like to work the detail of my cases out. There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him, either here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently guarded?\"  \"Well, you are master of the situation. I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small. However, if you can catch him I don\\'t see how I can refuse you an interview with him.\"  \"That is understood, then?\"  \"Perfectly. Is there anything else?\"  \"Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little choice in white wines.--Watson, you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper.\"      CHAPTER X The End of the Islander   Our meal was a merry one. Holmes coud talk exceedingly well when he chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a quick succession of subjects,--on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of the future,--handling each as though he had made a special study of it. His bright humor marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and face his dinner with the air of a bon vivant. For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes\\'s gaiety. None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.  When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at this watch, and filled up three glasses with port. \"One bumper,\" said he, \"to the success of our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a pistol, Watson?\"  \"I have my old service-revolver in my desk.\"  \"You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.\"  It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically.  \"Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\"  \"Yes,--that green lamp at the side.\"  \"Then take it off.\"  The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.  \"Where to?\" asked Jones.  \"To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson\\'s Yard.\"  Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.  \"We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\" he said.  \"Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.\"  \"We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces,--though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time--as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge--he could hardly leave at a moment\\'s notice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\"  \"It seems to me to be a little weak,\" said I. \"It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition.\"  \"No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion, however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad light. Now, it was past three o\\'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took, and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies.\"  \"But the launch? They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\"  \"Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way of doing it. I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or hard, and so be effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a few hours\\' notice.\"  \"That seems simple enough.\"  \"It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once in this harmless seaman\\'s rig and inquired at all the yards down the river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth--Jacobson\\'s--I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. \\'There ain\\'t naught amiss with her rudder,\\' said the foreman. \\'There she lies, with the red streaks.\\' At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse for liquor. I should not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch. \\'I want her to-night at eight o\\'clock,\\' said he,--\\'eight o\\'clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won\\'t be kept waiting.\\' They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I went back to the yard, and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at water\\'s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start. We shall be lying off in the stream, and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\"  \"You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or not,\" said Jones; \"but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson\\'s Yard, and arrested them when they came down.\"  \"Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week.\"  \"But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their hiding-place,\" said I.  \"In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\"  While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul\\'s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower.  \"That is Jacobson\\'s Yard,\" said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side. \"Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters.\" He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \"I see my sentry at his post,\" he remarked, \"but no sign of a handkerchief.\"  \"Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\" said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.  \"We have no right to take anything for granted,\" Holmes answered. \"It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We must stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight.\"  \"They are coming from work in the yard.\"  \"Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at them. There is no a priori probability about it. A strange enigma is man!\"  \"Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\" I suggested.  \"Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,\" said Holmes. \"He remarks that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.\"  \"Yes, it is your boy,\" I cried. \"I can see him plainly.\"  \"And there is the Aurora,\" exclaimed Holmes, \"and going like the devil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us!\"  She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head.  \"She is very fast,\" he said. \"I doubt if we shall catch her.\"  \"We must catch her!\" cried Holmes, between his teeth. \"Heap it on, stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have them!\"  We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp, steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We flashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track.  \"Pile it on, men, pile it on!\" cried Holmes, looking down into the engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager, aquiline face. \"Get every pound of steam you can.\"  \"I think we gain a little,\" said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.  \"I am sure of it,\" said I. \"We shall be up with her in a very few minutes.\"  At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat\\'s lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized, powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.  \"Fire if he raises his hand,\" said Holmes, quietly. We were within a boat\\'s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern.  It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.  \"See here,\" said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. \"We were hardly quick enough with our pistols.\" There, sure enough, just behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.      CHAPTER XI The Great Agra Treasure   Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes.  \"Well, Jonathan Small,\" said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \"I am sorry that it has come to this.\"  \"And so am I, sir,\" he answered, frankly. \"I don\\'t believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again.\"  \"Have a cigar,\" said Holmes; \"and you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?\"  \"You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it\\'s cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever.\"  \"You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you.  I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room.\"  \"That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I\\'d have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don\\'t feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing,\" he added, with a bitter smile, \"that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\"  At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin. \"Quite a family party,\" he remarked. \"I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes.  Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn\\'t take the other alive; but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her.\"  \"All is well that ends well,\" said Holmes. \"But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a clipper.\"  \"Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\"  \"Neither he did,\" cried our prisoner,--\"not a word. I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.\"  \"Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them.\" It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes\\'s face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.  \"We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\" said Jones, \"and shall land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no doubt?\"  \"Yes, I shall drive.\"  \"It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first. You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?\"  \"At the bottom of the river,\" said Small, shortly.  \"Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station.\"  They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour\\'s drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester\\'s. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.  She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.  \"I heard a cab drive up,\" she said. \"I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you. What news have you brought me?\"  \"I have brought something better than news,\" said I, putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my heart was heavy within me. \"I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune.\"  She glanced at iron box. \"Is that the treasure, then?\" she asked, coolly enough.  \"Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto\\'s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?\"  I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.  \"If I have it,\" said she, \"I owe it to you.\"  \"No, no,\" I answered, \"not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes. With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius.  As it was, we very nearly lost it at the last moment.\"  \"Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\" said she.  I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last,--Holmes\\'s new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint.  \"It is nothing,\" she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water. \"I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril.\"  \"That is all over,\" I answered. \"It was nothing. I will tell you no more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\"  \"It would be of the greatest interest to me,\" she said. There was no eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win.  \"What a pretty box!\" she said, stooping over it. \"This is Indian work, I suppose?\"  \"Yes; it is Benares metal-work.\"  \"And so heavy!\" she exclaimed, trying to raise it. \"The box alone must be of some value. Where is the key?\"  \"Small threw it into the Thames,\" I answered. \"I must borrow Mrs. Forrester\\'s poker.\" There was in the front a thick and broad hasp, wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!  No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and completely empty.  \"The treasure is lost,\" said Miss Morstan, calmly.  As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed. It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. \"Thank God!\" I ejaculated from my very heart.  She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. \"Why do you say that?\" she asked.  \"Because you are within my reach again,\" I said, taking her hand. She did not withdraw it. \"Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is why I said, \\'Thank God.\\'\"  \"Then I say, \\'Thank God,\\' too,\" she whispered, as I drew her to my side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained one.      CHAPTER XII The Strange Story of Jonathan Small   A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box.  \"There goes the reward!\" said he, gloomily. \"Where there is no money there is no pay. This night\\'s work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\"  \"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\" I said. \"He will see that you are rewarded, treasure or no.\"  The inspector shook his head despondently, however. \"It\\'s a bad job,\" he repeated; \"and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\"  His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.  \"This is your doing, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, angrily.  \"Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\" he cried, exultantly. \"It is my treasure; and if I can\\'t have the loot I\\'ll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It\\'s been the sign of four with us always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. You\\'ll find the treasure where the key is, and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey.\"  \"You are deceiving us, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, sternly. \"If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all.\"  \"Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\" he answered, with a shrewd, sidelong look. \"The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when you came up with us. However, there\\'s no good grieving over it. I\\'ve had ups in my life, and I\\'ve had downs, but I\\'ve learned not to cry over spilled milk.\"  \"This is a very serious matter, Small,\" said the detective. \"If you had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have had a better chance at your trial.\"  \"Justice!\" snarled the ex-convict. \"A pretty justice! Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga\\'s darts in my hide, than live in a convict\\'s cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine.\" Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.  \"You forget that we know nothing of all this,\" said Holmes quietly. \"We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side.\"  \"Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you is God\\'s truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass beside me here, and I\\'ll put my lips to it if I am dry.  \"I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore. I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen\\'s shilling and joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India.  \"I wasn\\'t destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation.  \"I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened to be a friend of our colonel\\'s, who had taken an interest in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home.  \"Well, I was never in luck\\'s way long. Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson\\'s wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite\\'s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra.  \"As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The whole country was up like a swarm of bees. Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the 3d Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city. Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side,--which is not to be wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it. Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south. From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage.  \"The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort at Agra. I don\\'t know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It is a very queer place,--the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all, it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring.  \"The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organize a central guard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack.  \"Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah. They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream. Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts, to make sure that all was well.  \"The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving rain. It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed, and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.  \"My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault. If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered, \\'Don\\'t make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.\\' There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow\\'s brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.  \"\\'Listen to me, Sahib,\\' said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the one whom they called Abdullah Khan. \\'You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever. The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate. Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army. There is no middle way. Which is it to be, death or life? We can only give you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must be done before the rounds come again.\\'  \"\\'How can I decide?\\' said I. \\'You have not told me what you want of me. But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife and welcome.\\'  \"\\'It is nothing against the fort,\\' said he. \\'We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for. We ask you to be rich. If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon the naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot. A quarter of the treasure shall be yours. We can say no fairer.\\'  \"\\'But what is the treasure, then?\\' I asked. \\'I am as ready to be rich as you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.\\'  \"\\'You will swear, then,\\' said he, \\'by the bones of your father, by the honor of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and speak no word against us, either now or afterwards?\\'  \"\\'I will swear it,\\' I answered, \\'provided that the fort is not endangered.\\'  \"\\'Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.\\'  \"\\'There are but three,\\' said I.  \"\\'No; Dost Akbar must have his share. We can tell the tale to you while we await them. Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give notice of their coming. The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that we may trust you. Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon the knife, and your body in the water. But the Sikh knows the Englishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh. Hearken, then, to what I have to say.  \"\\'There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth, though his lands are small. Much has come to him from his father, and more still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it. When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger,--with the Sepoy and with the Company\\'s raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men\\'s day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty servant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders. By doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt.  \"\\'This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now in the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort. He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who knows his secret. Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose. Here he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him. The place is lonely, and none shall know of his coming. The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us. What say you to it, Sahib?\\'  \"In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne\\'er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores. I had, therefore, already made up my mind. Abdullah Khan, however, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.  \"\\'Consider, Sahib,\\' said he, \\'that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now, since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well? The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company\\'s coffers. There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men. What could be better for the purpose?  Say again, then, Sahib, whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.\\'  \"\\'I am with you heart and soul,\\' said I.  \"\\'It is well,\\' he answered, handing me back my firelock. \\'You see that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.\\'  \"\\'Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?\\' I asked.  \"\\'The plan is his. He has devised it. We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh.\\'  \"The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of the wet season. Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast. A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed. It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death.  \"Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat. It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction.  \"\\'Here they are!\\' I exclaimed.  \"\\'You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,\\' whispered Abdullah. \\'Give him no cause for fear. Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard. Have the lantern ready to uncover, that we may be sure that it is indeed the man.\\'  \"The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat. I let them scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb half-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.  \"\\'Who goes there?\\' said I, in a subdued voice.  \"\\'Friends,\\' came the answer. I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them. The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund. Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man. The other was a little, fat, round fellow, with a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a shawl. He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands twitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole. It gave me the chills to think of killing him, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint within me. When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me.  \"\\'Your protection, Sahib,\\' he panted,--\\'your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra. I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company. It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety,--I and my poor possessions.\\'  \"\\'What have you in the bundle?\\' I asked.  \"\\'An iron box,\\' he answered, \\'which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to lose. Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and your governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.\\'  \"I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man. The more I looked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood. It was best to get it over.  \"\\'Take him to the main guard,\\' said I. The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in through the dark gate-way. Never was a man so compassed round with death. I remained at the gate-way with the lantern.  \"I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long, straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favor or not.\"  He stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him. For myself, I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it. Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me. Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply interested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their faces.  He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded.  \"It was all very bad, no doubt,\" said he. \"I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains. Besides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort. If he had got out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very lenient at a time like that.\"  \"Go on with your story,\" said Holmes, shortly.  \"Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I. A fine weight he was, too, for all that he was so short. Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door. We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared. It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces. The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural grave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him over with loose bricks. This done, we all went back to the treasure.  \"It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked. The box was the same which now lies open upon your table. A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, \\'the Great Mogul\\' and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats\\'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it.  \"After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.  \"Well, there\\'s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny. After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken. Fresh troops came pouring in, and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it. Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder. In a moment, however, our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.  \"It came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder,--three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others.  \"It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it. It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and water to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside, just waiting to be picked up. It might have driven me mad; but I was always a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.  \"At last it seemed to me to have come. I was changed from Agra to Madras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans. There are very few white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from the first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person. I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging, and ditching, and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge. All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas: so it was a terribly difficult job to get away.  \"The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards. The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game. A very snug little party they used to make.  \"Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win. Mind, I don\\'t say that there was anything unfair, but so it was. These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans, and they knew each other\\'s game to a point, while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow. Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a few deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever. All day he would wander about as black as thunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.  \"One night he lost even more heavily than usual. I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters. They were bosom friends, those two, and never far apart. The major was raving about his losses.  \"\\'It\\'s all up, Morstan,\\' he was saying, as they passed my hut. \\'I shall have to send in my papers. I am a ruined man.\\'  \"\\'Nonsense, old chap!\\' said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder. \\'I\\'ve had a nasty facer myself, but--\\' That was all I could hear, but it was enough to set me thinking.  A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I took the chance of speaking to him.  \"\\'I wish to have your advice, major,\\' said I.  \"\\'Well, Small, what is it?\\' he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.  \"\\'I wanted to ask you, sir,\\' said I, \\'who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over. I know where half a million worth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me.\\'  \"\\'Half a million, Small?\\' he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest.  \"\\'Quite that, sir,--in jewels and pearls. It lies there ready for anyone. And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.\\'  \"\\'To government, Small,\\' he stammered,--\\'to government.\\' But he said it in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.  \"\\'You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the Governor-General?\\' said I, quietly.  \"\\'Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent. Let me hear all about it, Small. Give me the facts.\\'  \"I told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not identify the places. When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought. I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him.  \"\\'This is a very important matter, Small,\\' he said, at last. \\'You must not say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.\\'  \"Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern.  \"\\'I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips, Small,\\' said he.  \"I repeated it as I had told it before.  \"\\'It rings true, eh?\\' said he. \\'It\\'s good enough to act upon?\\'  \"Captain Morstan nodded.  \"\\'Look here, Small,\\' said the major. \\'We have been talking it over, my friend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private concern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best. Now, the question is, what price would you ask for it? We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if we could agree as to terms.\\' He tried to speak in a cool, careless way, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.  \"\\'Why, as to that, gentlemen,\\' I answered, trying also to be cool, but feeling as excited as he did, \\'there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make. I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and to help my three companions to theirs.  We shall then take yo into partnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.\\'  \"\\'Hum!\\' said he. \\'A fifth share! That is not very tempting.\\'  \"\\'It would come to fifty thousand apiece,\\' said I.  \"\\'But how can we gain your freedom? You know very well that you ask an impossibility.\\'  \"\\'Nothing of the sort,\\' I answered. \\'I have thought it all out to the last detail. The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time. There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well. Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get aboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain.\\'  \"\\'If there were only one,\\' he said.  \"\\'None or all,\\' I answered. \\'We have sworn it. The four of us must always act together.\\'  \"\\'You see, Morstan,\\' said he, \\'Small is a man of his word. He does not flinch from his friend. I think we may very well trust him.\\'  \"\\'It\\'s a dirty business,\\' the other answered. \\'Yet, as you say, the money would save our commissions handsomely.\\'  \"\\'Well, Small,\\' said the major, \\'we must, I suppose, try and meet you. We must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where the box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.\\'  \"\\'Not so fast,\\' said I, growing colder as he got hot. \\'I must have the consent of my three comrades. I tell you that it is four or none with us.\\'  \"\\'Nonsense!\\' he broke in. \\'What have three black fellows to do with our agreement?\\'  \"\\'Black or blue,\\' said I, \\'they are in with me, and we all go together.\\'  \"Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present. We talked the matter over again, and at last we came to an arrangement. We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid. Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story. If he found the box he was to leave it there, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to lie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and finally to return to his duties. Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major\\'s share as well as his own. All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter. I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by the morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of four,--that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.  \"Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey. I\\'ll make it as short as I can. The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army, yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all, without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. From that day I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law,--nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,--that was my one thought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto.  \"Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one which I did not carry out. But it was weary years before my time came. I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine. One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods. He was sick to death, and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk. He took a kind of fancy to me then, and would hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut. I learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the fonder of me.  \"Tonga--for that was his name--was a fine boatman, and owned a big, roomy canoe of his own. When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it over with him. He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up. I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams, cocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes.  \"He was stanch and true, was little Tonga. No man ever had a more faithful mate. At the night named he had his boat at the wharf. As it chanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,--a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me. I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island. He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine on his shoulder. I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with, but none could I see.  \"Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon. I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg. With three long hops I was on him. He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail. For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims. They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them. They had one very good quality: they let you alone and asked no questions.  \"Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until the sun was shining. Here and there we drifted about the world, something always turning up to keep us from London. All the time, however, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at night. A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure, or if he still had it. I made friends with someone who could help me,--I name no names, for I don\\'t want to get any one else in a hole,--and I soon found that he still had the jewels. Then I tried to get at him in many ways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides his sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him.  \"One day, however, I got word that he was dying. I hurried at once to the garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and, looking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons on each side of him. I\\'d have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however: so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred: so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom. It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.  \"We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal. He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day\\'s work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house, in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto\\'s chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trap-door in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto\\'s supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope\\'s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp. I took the treasure-box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come.  \"I don\\'t know that I have anything else to tell you. I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith\\'s launch, the Aurora, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape. I engaged with old Smith, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship. He knew, no doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our secrets. All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it is not to amuse you,--for you have not done me a very good turn,--but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\"  \"A very remarkable account,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case. There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own rope. That I did not know. By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\"  \"He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe at the time.\"  \"Ah, of course,\" said Holmes. \"I had not thought of that.\"  \"Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?\" asked the convict, affably.  \"I think not, thank you,\" my companion answered.  \"Well, Holmes,\" said Athelney Jones, \"You are a man to be humored, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors down-stairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you.\"  \"Good-night, gentlemen both,\" said Jonathan Small.  \"You first, Small,\" remarked the wary Jones as they left the room. \"I\\'ll take particular care that you don\\'t club me with your wooden leg, whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.\"  \"Well, and there is the end of our little drama,\" I remarked, after we had set some time smoking in silence. \"I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods. Miss Morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective.\"  He gave a most dismal groan. \"I feared as much,\" said he. \"I really cannot congratulate you.\"  I was a little hurt. \"Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice?\" I asked.  \"Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\"  \"I trust,\" said I, laughing, \"that my judgment may survive the ordeal. But you look weary.\"  \"Yes, the reaction is already upon me. I shall be as limp as a rag for a week.\"  \"Strange,\" said I, \"how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor.\"  \"Yes,\" he answered, \"there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow. I often think of those lines of old Goethe,--  Schade, daÃŸ die Natur nur einen Mensch aus Dir schuf, Denn zum wÃ¼rdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.  \"By the way, a propos of this Norwood business, you see that they had, as I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than Lal Rao, the butler: so Jones actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul.\"  \"The division seems rather unfair,\" I remarked. \"You have done all the work in this business. I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit, pray what remains for you?\"  \"For me,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"there still remains the cocaine-bottle.\" And he stretched his long white hand up for it.       THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES      A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA      Table of contents Chapter 1 Chapter 2 Chapter 3                CHAPTER I    To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men\\'s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.  I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.  One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.  His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.  \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"  \"Seven!\" I answered.  \"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.\"  \"Then, how do you know?\"  \"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?\"  \"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can\\'t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\"  He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.  \"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.\"  I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. \"When I hear you give your reasons,\" I remarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\"  \"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\"  \"Frequently.\"  \"How often?\"  \"Well, some hundreds of times.\"  \"Then how many are there?\"  \"How many? I don\\'t know.\"  \"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\" He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. \"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read it aloud.\"  The note was undated, and without either signature or address.  \"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o\\'clock,\" it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.\"  \"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that it means?\"  \"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?\"  I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.  \"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion\\'s processes. \"Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.\"  \"Peculiar--that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"  I did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a large \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.  \"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.  \"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.\"  \"Not at all. The \\'G\\' with the small \\'t\\' stands for \\'Gesellschaft,\\' which is the German for \\'Company.\\' It is a customary contraction like our \\'Co.\\' \\'P,\\' of course, stands for \\'Papier.\\' Now for the \\'Eg.\\' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.\" He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. \"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. \\'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.\\' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?\" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.  \"The paper was made in Bohemia,\" I said.  \"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--\\'This account of you we have from all quarters received.\\' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.\"  As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses\\' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.  \"A pair, by the sound,\" said he. \"Yes,\" he continued, glancing out of the window. \"A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There\\'s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.\"  \"I think that I had better go, Holmes.\"  \"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.\"  \"But your client--\"  \"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.\"  A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.  \"Come in!\" said Holmes.  A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.  \"You had my note?\" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. \"I told you that I would call.\" He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.  \"Pray take a seat,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?\"  \"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.\"  I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. \"It is both, or none,\" said he. \"You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.\"  The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Then I must begin,\" said he, \"by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.\"  \"I promise,\" said Holmes.  \"And I.\"  \"You will excuse this mask,\" continued our strange visitor. \"The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.\"  \"I was aware of it,\" said Holmes dryly.  \"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.\"  \"I was also aware of that,\" murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.  Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.  \"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,\" he remarked, \"I should be better able to advise you.\"  The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. \"You are right,\" he cried; \"I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?\"  \"Why, indeed?\" murmured Holmes. \"Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.\"  \"But you can understand,\" said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, \"you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.\"  \"Then, pray consult,\" said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.  \"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.\"  \"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,\" murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.  \"Let me see!\" said Holmes. \"Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.\"  \"Precisely so. But how--\"  \"Was there a secret marriage?\"  \"None.\"  \"No legal papers or certificates?\"  \"None.\"  \"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?\"  \"There is the writing.\"  \"Pooh, pooh! Forgery.\"  \"My private note-paper.\"  \"Stolen.\"  \"My own seal.\"  \"Imitated.\"  \"My photograph.\"  \"Bought.\"  \"We were both in the photograph.\"  \"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.\"  \"I was mad--insane.\"  \"You have compromised yourself seriously.\"  \"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.\"  \"It must be recovered.\"  \"We have tried and failed.\"  \"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.\"  \"She will not sell.\"  \"Stolen, then.\"  \"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.\"  \"No sign of it?\"  \"Absolutely none.\"  Holmes laughed. \"It is quite a pretty little problem,\" said he.  \"But a very serious one to me,\" returned the King reproachfully.  \"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?\"  \"To ruin me.\"  \"But how?\"  \"I am about to be married.\"  \"So I have heard.\"  \"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.\"  \"And Irene Adler?\"  \"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none.\"  \"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?\"  \"I am sure.\"  \"And why?\"  \"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.\"  \"Oh, then we have three days yet,\" said Holmes with a yawn. \"That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?\"  \"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.\"  \"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.\"  \"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.\"  \"Then, as to money?\"  \"You have carte blanche.\"  \"Absolutely?\"  \"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.\"  \"And for present expenses?\"  The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.  \"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,\" he said.  Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.  \"And Mademoiselle\\'s address?\" he asked.  \"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John\\'s Wood.\"  Holmes took a note of it. \"One other question,\" said he. \"Was the photograph a cabinet?\"  \"It was.\"  \"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,\" he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. \"If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o\\'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.\"      CHAPTER II    At three o\\'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o\\'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.  It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend\\'s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.  \"Well, really!\" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.  \"What is it?\"  \"It\\'s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.\"  \"I can\\'t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.\"  \"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o\\'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.  \"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.\"  \"And what of Irene Adler?\" I asked.  \"Oh, she has turned all the men\\'s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.  \"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman\\'s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.\"  \"I am following you closely,\" I answered.  \"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.  \"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, \\'Drive like the devil,\\' he shouted, \\'first to Gross & Hankey\\'s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!\\'  \"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn\\'t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.  \"\\'The Church of St. Monica, John,\\' she cried, \\'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\'  \"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. \\'The Church of St. Monica,\\' said I, \\'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.\\' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.  \"My cabby drove fast. I don\\'t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.  \"\\'Thank God,\\' he cried. \\'You\\'ll do. Come! Come!\\'  \"\\'What then?\\' I asked.  \"\\'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won\\'t be legal.\\'  \"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.\"  \"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,\" said I; \"and what then?\"  \"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. \\'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,\\' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.\"  \"Which are?\"  \"Some cold beef and a glass of beer,\" he answered, ringing the bell. \"I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.\"  \"I shall be delighted.\"  \"You don\\'t mind breaking the law?\"  \"Not in the least.\"  \"Nor running a chance of arrest?\"  \"Not in a good cause.\"  \"Oh, the cause is excellent!\"  \"Then I am your man.\"  \"I was sure that I might rely on you.\"  \"But what is it you wish?\"  \"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,\" he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, \"I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.\"  \"And what then?\"  \"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?\"  \"I am to be neutral?\"  \"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?\"  \"Entirely.\"  \"It is nothing very formidable,\" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. \"It is an ordinary plumber\\'s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?\"  \"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.\"  \"Precisely.\"  \"Then you may entirely rely on me.\"  \"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.\"  He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.  It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes\\' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.  \"You see,\" remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, \"this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is--Where are we to find the photograph?\"  \"Where, indeed?\"  \"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman\\'s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.\"  \"Where, then?\"  \"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.\"  \"But it has twice been burgled.\"  \"Pshaw! They did not know how to look.\"  \"But how will you look?\"  \"I will not look.\"  \"What then?\"  \"I will get her to show me.\"  \"But she will refuse.\"  \"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.\"  As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.  \"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?\" she asked.  \"He is dead,\" cried several voices.  \"No, no, there\\'s life in him!\" shouted another. \"But he\\'ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.\"  \"He\\'s a brave fellow,\" said a woman. \"They would have had the lady\\'s purse and watch if it hadn\\'t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he\\'s breathing now.\"  \"He can\\'t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?\"  \"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!\"  Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.  Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of \"Fire!\" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of \"Fire!\" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend\\'s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.  \"You did it very nicely, Doctor,\" he remarked. \"Nothing could have been better. It is all right.\"  \"You have the photograph?\"  \"I know where it is.\"  \"And how did you find out?\"  \"She showed me, as I told you she would.\"  \"I am still in the dark.\"  \"I do not wish to make a mystery,\" said he, laughing. \"The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.\"  \"I guessed as much.\"  \"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.\"  \"That also I could fathom.\"  \"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.\"  \"How did that help you?\"  \"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.\"  \"And now?\" I asked.  \"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.\"  \"And when will you call?\"  \"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.\"  We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:  \"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.\"  There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.  \"I\\'ve heard that voice before,\" said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. \"Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.\"      CHAPTER III    I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.  \"You have really got it!\" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.  \"Not yet.\"  \"But you have hopes?\"  \"I have hopes.\"  \"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.\"  \"We must have a cab.\"  \"No, my brougham is waiting.\"  \"Then that will simplify matters.\" We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.  \"Irene Adler is married,\" remarked Holmes.  \"Married! When?\"  \"Yesterday.\"  \"But to whom?\"  \"To an English lawyer named Norton.\"  \"But she could not love him.\"  \"I am in hopes that she does.\"  \"And why in hopes?\"  \"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty\\'s plan.\"  \"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!\" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.  The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.  \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?\" said she.  \"I am Mr. Holmes,\" answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.  \"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.\"  \"What!\" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. \"Do you mean that she has left England?\"  \"Never to return.\"  \"And the papers?\" asked the King hoarsely. \"All is lost.\"  \"We shall see.\" He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to \"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.\" My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:  \"My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes: \"You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed. \"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband. \"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, \"Very truly yours, \"Irene Norton, nÃ©e Adler.\"  \"What a woman--oh, what a woman!\" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. \"Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?\"  \"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,\" said Holmes coldly. \"I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty\\'s business to a more successful conclusion.\"  \"On the contrary, my dear sir,\" cried the King; \"nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.\"  \"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.\"  \"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--\" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.  \"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,\" said Holmes.  \"You have but to name it.\"  \"This photograph!\"  The King stared at him in amazement.  \"Irene\\'s photograph!\" he cried. \"Certainly, if you wish it.\"  \"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.\" He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.  And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman\\'s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.       THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE  I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.  \"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,\" he said cordially.  \"I was afraid that you were engaged.\"  \"So I am. Very much so.\"  \"Then I can wait in the next room.\"  \"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also.\"  The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.  \"Try the settee,\" said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. \"I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.\"  \"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,\" I observed.  \"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination.\"  \"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.\"  \"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.\"  The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.  I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd\\'s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.  Sherlock Holmes\\' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. \"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.\"  Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.  \"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?\" he asked. \"How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It\\'s as true as gospel, for I began as a ship\\'s carpenter.\"  \"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.\"  \"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?\"  \"I won\\'t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin.\"  \"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?\"  \"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?\"  \"Well, but China?\"  \"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes\\' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.\"  Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. \"Well, I never!\" said he. \"I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it, after all.\"  \"I begin to think, Watson,\" said Holmes, \"that I make a mistake in explaining. \\'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,\\' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?\"  \"Yes, I have got it now,\" he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. \"Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir.\"  I took the paper from him and read as follows:  \"To the Red-headed League: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of Â£4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o\\'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope\\'s Court, Fleet Street.\"  \"What on earth does this mean?\" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.  Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. \"It is a little off the beaten track, isn\\'t it?\" said he. \"And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date.\"  \"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.\"  \"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?\"  \"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; \"I have a small pawnbroker\\'s business at Coburg Square, near the City. It\\'s not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business.\"  \"What is the name of this obliging youth?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.  \"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he\\'s not such a youth, either. It\\'s hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?\"  \"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employee who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don\\'t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement.\"  \"Oh, he has his faults, too,\" said Mr. Wilson. \"Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he\\'s a good worker. There\\'s no vice in him.\"  \"He is still with you, I presume?\"  \"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that\\'s all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.  \"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:  \"\\'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.\\'  \"\\'Why that?\\' I asks.  \"\\'Why,\\' says he, \\'here\\'s another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It\\'s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits\\' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here\\'s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.\\'  \"\\'Why, what is it, then?\\' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn\\'t know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.  \"\\'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?\\' he asked with his eyes open.  \"\\'Never.\\'  \"\\'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.\\'  \"\\'And what are they worth?\\' I asked.  \"\\'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one\\'s other occupations.\\'  \"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.  \"\\'Tell me all about it,\\' said I.  \"\\'Well,\\' said he, showing me the advertisement, \\'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.\\'  \"\\'But,\\' said I, \\'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.\\'  \"\\'Not so many as you might think,\\' he answered. \\'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.\\'  \"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.  \"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope\\'s Court looked like a coster\\'s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.\"  \"Your experience has been a most entertaining one,\" remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. \"Pray continue your very interesting statement.\"  \"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.  \"\\'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,\\' said my assistant, \\'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.\\'  \"\\'And he is admirably suited for it,\\' the other answered. \\'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.\\' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.  \"\\'It would be injustice to hesitate,\\' said he. \\'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.\\' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. \\'There is water in your eyes,\\' said he as he released me. \\'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler\\'s wax which would disgust you with human nature.\\' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.  \"\\'My name,\\' said he, \\'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?\\'  \"I answered that I had not.  \"His face fell immediately.  \"\\'Dear me!\\' he said gravely, \\'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.\\'  \"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.  \"\\'In the case of another,\\' said he, \\'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?\\'  \"\\'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,\\' said I.  \"\\'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!\\' said Vincent Spaulding. \\'I should be able to look after that for you.\\'  \"\\'What would be the hours?\\' I asked.  \"\\'Ten to two.\\'  \"Now a pawnbroker\\'s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.  \"\\'That would suit me very well,\\' said I. \\'And the pay?\\'  \"\\'Is Â£4 a week.\\'  \"\\'And the work?\\'  \"\\'Is purely nominal.\\'  \"\\'What do you call purely nominal?\\'  \"\\'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don\\'t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.\\'  \"\\'It\\'s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,\\' said I.  \"\\'No excuse will avail,\\' said Mr. Duncan Ross; \\'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.\\'  \"\\'And the work?\\'  \"\\'Is to copy out the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica.\" There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?\\'  \"\\'Certainly,\\' I answered.  \"\\'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.\\' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.  \"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the \\'Encyclopaedia Britannica.\\' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope\\'s Court.  \"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o\\'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.  \"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week\\'s work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.  \"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B\\'s before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end.\"  \"To an end?\"  \"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o\\'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself.\"  He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:  The Red-headed League is Dissolved October 9, 1890.  Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.  \"I cannot see that there is anything very funny,\" cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. \"If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.\"  \"No, no,\" cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. \"I really wouldn\\'t miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?\"  \"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.  \"\\'Well,\\' said I, \\'the gentleman at No. 4.\\'  \"\\'What, the red-headed man?\\'  \"\\'Yes.\\'  \"\\'Oh,\\' said he, \\'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.\\'  \"\\'Where could I find him?\\'  \"\\'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul\\'s.\\'  \"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.\"  \"And what did you do then?\" asked Holmes.  \"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you.\"  \"And you did very wisely,\" said Holmes. \"Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear.\"  \"Grave enough!\" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. \"Why, I have lost four pound a week.\"  \"As far as you are personally concerned,\" remarked Holmes, \"I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some Â£30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.\"  \"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds.\"  \"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?\"  \"About a month then.\"  \"How did he come?\"  \"In answer to an advertisement.\"  \"Was he the only applicant?\"  \"No, I had a dozen.\"  \"Why did you pick him?\"  \"Because he was handy and would come cheap.\"  \"At half-wages, in fact.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?\"  \"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he\\'s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead.\"  Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. \"I thought as much,\" said he. \"Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?\"  \"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad.\"  \"Hum!\" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. \"He is still with you?\"  \"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him.\"  \"And has your business been attended to in your absence?\"  \"Nothing to complain of, sir. There\\'s never very much to do of a morning.\"  \"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.\"  \"Well, Watson,\" said Holmes when our visitor had left us, \"what do you make of it all?\"  \"I make nothing of it,\" I answered frankly. \"It is a most mysterious business.\"  \"As a rule,\" said Holmes, \"the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.\"  \"What are you going to do, then?\" I asked.  \"To smoke,\" he answered. \"It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won\\'t speak to me for fifty minutes.\" He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.  \"Sarasate plays at the St. James\\'s Hall this afternoon,\" he remarked. \"What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?\"  \"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.\"  \"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!\"  We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with \"Jabez Wilson\" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker\\'s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.  \"Thank you,\" said Holmes, \"I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand.\"  \"Third right, fourth left,\" answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.  \"Smart fellow, that,\" observed Holmes as we walked away. \"He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before.\"  \"Evidently,\" said I, \"Mr. Wilson\\'s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him.\"  \"Not him.\"  \"What then?\"  \"The knees of his trousers.\"  \"And what did you see?\"  \"What I expected to see.\"  \"Why did you beat the pavement?\"  \"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy\\'s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.\"  The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.  \"Let me see,\" said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, \"I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer\\'s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane\\'s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we\\'ve done our work, so it\\'s time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.\"  My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James\\'s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.  \"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor,\" he remarked as we emerged.  \"Yes, it would be as well.\"  \"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious.\"  \"Why serious?\"  \"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.\"  \"At what time?\"  \"Ten will be early enough.\"  \"I shall be at Baker Street at ten.\"  \"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket.\" He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.  I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the \"Encyclopaedia\" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?  Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker\\'s assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.  It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.  \"Ha! Our party is complete,\" said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. \"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night\\'s adventure.\"  \"We\\'re hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see,\" said Jones in his consequential way. \"Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.\"  \"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,\" observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.  \"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,\" said the police agent loftily. \"He has his own little methods, which are, if he won\\'t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force.\"  \"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,\" said the stranger with deference. \"Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber.\"  \"I think you will find,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some Â£30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands.\"  \"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He\\'s a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He\\'s a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He\\'ll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I\\'ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.\"  \"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I\\'ve had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second.\"  Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.  \"We are close there now,\" my friend remarked. \"This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.\"  We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.  \"You are not very vulnerable from above,\" Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.  \"Nor from below,\" said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. \"Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!\" he remarked, looking up in surprise.  \"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!\" said Holmes severely. \"You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?\"  The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.  \"We have at least an hour before us,\" he remarked, \"for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present.\"  \"It is our French gold,\" whispered the director. \"We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.\"  \"Your French gold?\"  \"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject.\"  \"Which were very well justified,\" observed Holmes. \"And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern.\"  \"And sit in the dark?\"  \"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrÃ©e, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy\\'s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.\"  I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment\\'s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.  \"They have but one retreat,\" whispered Holmes. \"That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?\"  \"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.\"  \"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait.\"  What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.  At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.  Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.  \"It\\'s all clear,\" he whispered. \"Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I\\'ll swing for it!\"  Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes\\' hunting crop came down on the man\\'s wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.  \"It\\'s no use, John Clay,\" said Holmes blandly. \"You have no chance at all.\"  \"So I see,\" the other answered with the utmost coolness. \"I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.\"  \"There are three men waiting for him at the door,\" said Holmes.  \"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you.\"  \"And I you,\" Holmes answered. \"Your red-headed idea was very new and effective.\"  \"You\\'ll see your pal again presently,\" said Jones. \"He\\'s quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.\"  \"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,\" remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. \"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say \\'sir\\' and \\'please.\\'\"  \"All right,\" said Jones with a stare and a snigger. \"Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?\"  \"That is better,\" said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.  \"Really, Mr. Holmes,\" said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, \"I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience.\"  \"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay,\" said Holmes. \"I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.\"  \"You see, Watson,\" he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, \"it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the \\'Encyclopaedia,\\' must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay\\'s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice\\'s hair. The Â£4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.\"  \"But how could you guess what the motive was?\"  \"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man\\'s business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant\\'s fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.  \"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend\\'s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.\"  \"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?\" I asked.  \"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson\\'s presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night.\"  \"You reasoned it out beautifully,\" I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. \"It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.\"  \"It saved me from ennui,\" he answered, yawning. \"Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.\"  \"And you are a benefactor of the race,\" said I.  He shrugged his shoulders. \"Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use,\" he remarked. \"\\'L\\'homme c\\'est rien--l\\'oeuvre c\\'est tout,\\' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand.\"       A CASE OF IDENTITY  \"My dear fellow,\" said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, \"life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outrÃ© results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.\"  \"And yet I am not convinced of it,\" I answered. \"The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic.\"  \"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect,\" remarked Holmes. \"This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace.\"  I smiled and shook my head. \"I can quite understand your thinking so.\" I said. \"Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here\"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--\"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. \\'A husband\\'s cruelty to his wife.\\' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude.\"  \"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,\" said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. \"This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example.\"  He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.  \"Ah,\" said he, \"I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers.\"  \"And the ring?\" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.  \"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems.\"  \"And have you any on hand just now?\" I asked with interest.  \"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.\"  He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.  \"I have seen those symptoms before,\" said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. \"Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts.\"  As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.  \"Do you not find,\" he said, \"that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?\"  \"I did at first,\" she answered, \"but now I know where the letters are without looking.\" Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. \"You\\'ve heard about me, Mr. Holmes,\" she cried, \"else how could you know all that?\"  \"Never mind,\" said Holmes, laughing; \"it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?\"  \"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I\\'m not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"  \"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?\" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.  Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. \"Yes, I did bang out of the house,\" she said, \"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you.\"  \"Your father,\" said Holmes, \"your stepfather, surely, since the name is different.\"  \"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself.\"  \"And your mother is alive?\"  \"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn\\'t best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father\\'s death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got Â£4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn\\'t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.\"  I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.  \"Your own little income,\" he asked, \"does it come out of the business?\"  \"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4Â½ per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest.\"  \"You interest me extremely,\" said Holmes. \"And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about Â£60.\"  \"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don\\'t wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.\"  \"You have made your position very clear to me,\" said Holmes. \"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"  A flush stole over Miss Sutherland\\'s face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. \"I met him first at the gasfitters\\' ball,\" she said. \"They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father\\'s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"  \"I suppose,\" said Holmes, \"that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.\"  \"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way.\"  \"I see. Then at the gasfitters\\' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"  \"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.\"  \"No?\"  \"Well, you know father didn\\'t like anything of the sort. He wouldn\\'t have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.\"  \"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?\"  \"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know.\"  \"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?\"  \"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--\"  \"What office?\"  \"That\\'s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don\\'t know.\"  \"Where did he live, then?\"  \"He slept on the premises.\"  \"And you don\\'t know his address?\"  \"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street.\"  \"Where did you address your letters, then?\"  \"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn\\'t have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of.\"  \"It was most suggestive,\" said Holmes. \"It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.  Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"  \"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He\\'d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare.\"  \"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?\"  \"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn\\'t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn\\'t want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding.\"  \"It missed him, then?\"  \"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.\"  \"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?\"  \"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour\\'s, near King\\'s Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.\"  \"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,\" said Holmes.  \"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.\"  \"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?\"  \"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.\"  \"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?\"  \"None.\"  \"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?\"  \"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.\"  \"And your father? Did you tell him?\"  \"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can\\'t sleep a wink at night.\" She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.  \"I shall glance into the case for you,\" said Holmes, rising, \"and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life.\"  \"Then you don\\'t think I\\'ll see him again?\"  \"I fear not.\"  \"Then what has happened to him?\"  \"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.\"  \"I advertised for him in last Saturday\\'s Chronicle,\" said she. \"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him.\"  \"Thank you. And your address?\"  \"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.\"  \"Mr. Angel\\'s address you never had, I understand. Where is your father\\'s place of business?\"  \"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street.\"  \"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life.\"  \"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.\"  For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.  Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.  \"Quite an interesting study, that maiden,\" he observed. \"I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in \\'77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.\"  \"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me,\" I remarked.  \"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman\\'s appearance? Describe it.\"  \"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn\\'t observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.\"  Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.  \"\\'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman\\'s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.\"  \"It surprised me.\"  \"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry.\"  \"And what else?\" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend\\'s incisive reasoning.  \"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?\"  I held the little printed slip to the light.  \"Missing,\" it said, \"on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--\"  \"That will do,\" said Holmes. \"As to the letters,\" he continued, glancing over them, \"they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.\"  \"They are typewritten,\" I remarked.  \"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little \\'Hosmer Angel\\' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive.\"  \"Of what?\"  \"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?\"  \"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.\"  \"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady\\'s stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o\\'clock tomorrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim.\"  I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend\\'s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.  I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.  A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o\\'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the dÃ©nouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.  \"Well, have you solved it?\" I asked as I entered.  \"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.\"  \"No, no, the mystery!\" I cried.  \"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.\"  \"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?\"  The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.  \"This is the girl\\'s stepfather, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes. \"He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!\"  The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.  \"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,\" said Holmes. \"I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o\\'clock?\"  \"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?\"  \"On the contrary,\" said Holmes quietly; \"I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.\"  Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. \"I am delighted to hear it,\" he said.  \"It is a curious thing,\" remarked Holmes, \"that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man\\'s handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the \\'e,\\' and a slight defect in the tail of the \\'r.\\' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious.\"  \"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn,\" our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.  \"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank,\" Holmes continued. \"I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the \\'e\\'s\\' slurred and the \\'r\\'s\\' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well.\"  Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. \"I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,\" he said. \"If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it.\"  \"Certainly,\" said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. \"I let you know, then, that I have caught him!\"  \"What! where?\" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.  \"Oh, it won\\'t do--really it won\\'t,\" said Holmes suavely. \"There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That\\'s right! Sit down and let us talk it over.\"  Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. \"It--it\\'s not actionable,\" he stammered.  \"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.\"  The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.  \"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,\" said he, \"and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl\\'s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself.\"  \"It was only a joke at first,\" groaned our visitor. \"We never thought that she would have been so carried away.\"  \"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman\\'s attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl\\'s affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady\\'s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!\"  Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.  \"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, \"but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.\"  \"The law cannot, as you say, touch you,\" said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, \"yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!\" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man\\'s face, \"it is not part of my duties to my client, but here\\'s a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--\" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.  \"There\\'s a cold-blooded scoundrel!\" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. \"That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.\"  \"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,\" I remarked.  \"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.\"  \"And how did you verify them?\"  \"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employee, James Windibank. VoilÃ\\xa0 tout!\"  \"And Miss Sutherland?\"  \"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, \\'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.\\' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.\"       THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY  We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:  \"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11.15.\" \"What do you say, dear?\" said my wife, looking across at me. \"Will you go?\"  \"I really don\\'t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.\"  \"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes\\' cases.\"  \"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them,\" I answered. \"But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour.\"  My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.  \"It is really very good of you to come, Watson,\" said he. \"It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.\"  We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.  \"Have you heard anything of the case?\" he asked.  \"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\"  \"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult.\"  \"That sounds a little paradoxical.\"  \"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man.\"  \"It is a murder, then?\"  \"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.  \"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.  \"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.  \"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.  \"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son\\'s gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of \\'wilful murder\\' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.\"  \"I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\" I remarked. \"If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.\"  \"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\" answered Holmes thoughtfully. \"It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home.\"  \"I am afraid,\" said I, \"that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case.\"  \"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\" he answered, laughing. \"Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that.\"  \"How on earth--\"  \"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my mÃ©tier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.\"  \"What are they?\"  \"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner\\'s jury.\"  \"It was a confession,\" I ejaculated.  \"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\"  \"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark.\"  \"On the contrary,\" said Holmes, \"it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one.\"  I shook my head. \"Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,\" I remarked.  \"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\"  \"What is the young man\\'s own account of the matter?\"  \"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\"  He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:  \"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: \\'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of \"Cooee!\" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner\\'s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.\\' \"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died? \"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat. \"The Coroner: What did you understand by that? \"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious. \"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel? \"Witness: I should prefer not to answer. \"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it. \"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed. \"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise. \"Witness: I must still refuse. \"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of \\'Cooee\\' was a common signal between you and your father? \"Witness: It was. \"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol? \"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know. \"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured? \"Witness: Nothing definite. \"The Coroner: What do you mean? \"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone. \"\\'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?\\' \"\\'Yes, it was gone.\\' \"\\'You cannot say what it was?\\' \"\\'No, I had a feeling something was there.\\' \"\\'How far from the body?\\' \"\\'A dozen yards or so.\\' \"\\'And how far from the edge of the wood?\\' \"\\'About the same.\\' \"\\'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?\\' \"\\'Yes, but with my back towards it.\\' \"This concluded the examination of the witness.\"  \"I see,\" said I as I glanced down the column, \"that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father\\'s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son.\"  Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. \"Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,\" said he, \"to single out the very strongest points in the young man\\'s favour. Don\\'t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outrÃ© as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes.\"  It was nearly four o\\'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.  \"I have ordered a carriage,\" said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. \"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\"  \"It was very nice and complimentary of you,\" Holmes answered. \"It is entirely a question of barometric pressure.\"  Lestrade looked startled. \"I do not quite follow,\" he said.  \"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.\"  Lestrade laughed indulgently. \"You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers,\" he said. \"The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can\\'t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.\"  He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.  \"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman\\'s quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, \"I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn\\'t do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\"  \"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\"  \"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?\"  \"I think that it is very probable.\"  \"There, now!\" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. \"You hear! He gives me hopes.\"  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\" he said.  \"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it.\"  \"In what way?\" asked Holmes.  \"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\"  \"And your father?\" asked Holmes. \"Was he in favour of such a union?\"  \"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it.\" A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.  \"Thank you for this information,\" said he. \"May I see your father if I call to-morrow?\"  \"I am afraid the doctor won\\'t allow it.\"  \"The doctor?\"  \"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\"  \"Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\"  \"Yes, at the mines.\"  \"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money.\"  \"Yes, certainly.\"  \"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.\"  \"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent.\"  \"I will, Miss Turner.\"  \"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\" She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.  \"I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\" said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes\\' silence. \"Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.\"  \"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\" said Holmes. \"Have you an order to see him in prison?\"  \"Yes, but only for you and me.\"  \"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\"  \"Ample.\"  \"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\"  I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man\\'s story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon\\'s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes\\' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade\\'s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes\\' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy\\'s innocence.  It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.  \"The glass still keeps very high,\" he remarked as he sat down. \"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.\"  \"And what did you learn from him?\"  \"Nothing.\"  \"Could he throw no light?\"  \"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart.\"  \"I cannot admire his taste,\" I remarked, \"if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner.\"  \"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all that he has suffered.\"  \"But if he is innocent, who has done it?\"  \"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry \\'Cooee!\\' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.\"  There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine o\\'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.  \"There is serious news this morning,\" Lestrade observed. \"It is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.\"  \"An elderly man, I presume?\" said Holmes.  \"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy\\'s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\"  \"Indeed! That is interesting,\" said Holmes.  \"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.\"  \"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his son to Turner\\'s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?\"  \"We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\" said Lestrade, winking at me. \"I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\"  \"You are right,\" said Holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard to tackle the facts.\"  \"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of,\" replied Lestrade with some warmth.  \"And that is--\"  \"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\"  \"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the left.\"  \"Yes, that is it.\" It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes\\' request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the son\\'s, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.  Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a definite end.  The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner\\'s dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.  \"What did you go into the pool for?\" he asked.  \"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--\"  \"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of the same feet.\" He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to himself than to us. \"These are young McCarthy\\'s feet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the father\\'s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\" He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the highroad, where all traces were lost.  \"It has been a case of considerable interest,\" he remarked, returning to his natural manner. \"I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.\"  It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood.  \"This may interest you, Lestrade,\" he remarked, holding it out.  \"The murder was done with it.\"  \"I see no marks.\"  \"There are none.\"  \"How do you know, then?\"  \"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.\"  \"And the murderer?\"  \"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search.\"  Lestrade laughed. \"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\" he said. \"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury.\"  \"Nous verrons,\" answered Holmes calmly. \"You work your own method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall probably return to London by the evening train.\"  \"And leave your case unfinished?\"  \"No, finished.\"  \"But the mystery?\"  \"It is solved.\"  \"Who was the criminal, then?\"  \"The gentleman I describe.\"  \"But who is he?\"  \"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood.\"  Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am a practical man,\" he said, \"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the laughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\"  \"All right,\" said Holmes quietly. \"I have given you the chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.\"  Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.  \"Look here, Watson,\" he said when the cloth was cleared \"just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don\\'t know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar and let me expound.\"  \"Pray do so.\"  \"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy\\'s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One was the fact that his father should, according to his account, cry \\'Cooee!\\' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son\\'s ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\"  \"What of this \\'Cooee!\\' then?\"  \"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. The \\'Cooee!\\' was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But \\'Cooee\\' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia.\"  \"What of the rat, then?\"  Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table. \"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\" he said. \"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\" He put his hand over part of the map. \"What do you read?\"  \"ARAT,\" I read.  \"And now?\" He raised his hand.  \"BALLARAT.\"  \"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\"  \"It is wonderful!\" I exclaimed.  \"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point which, granting the son\\'s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly wander.\"  \"Quite so.\"  \"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\"  \"But how did you gain them?\"  \"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.\"  \"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\"  \"Yes, they were peculiar boots.\"  \"But his lameness?\"  \"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame.\"  \"But his left-handedness.\"  \"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which are rolled in Rotterdam.\"  \"And the cigar-holder?\"  \"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\"  \"Holmes,\" I said, \"you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in which all this points. The culprit is--\"  \"Mr. John Turner,\" cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.  The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.  \"Pray sit down on the sofa,\" said Holmes gently. \"You had my note?\"  \"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.\"  \"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\"  \"And why did you wish to see me?\" He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.  \"Yes,\" said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \"It is so. I know all about McCarthy.\"  The old man sank his face in his hands. \"God help me!\" he cried. \"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.\"  \"I am glad to hear you say so,\" said Holmes gravely.  \"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested.\"  \"It may not come to that,\" said Holmes.  \"What?\"  \"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however.\"  \"I am a dying man,\" said old Turner. \"I have had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a jail.\"  Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him. \"Just tell us the truth,\" he said. \"I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed.\"  \"It\\'s as well,\" said the old man; \"it\\'s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.  \"You didn\\'t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my life. I\\'ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.  \"It was in the early \\'60\\'s at the diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.  \"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money, to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.  \"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.  \"\\'Here we are, Jack,\\' says he, touching me on the arm; \\'we\\'ll be as good as a family to you. There\\'s two of us, me and my son, and you can have the keeping of us. If you don\\'t--it\\'s a fine, law-abiding country is England, and there\\'s always a policeman within hail.\\'  \"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.  \"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.  \"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.\"  \"Well, it is not for me to judge you,\" said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn out. \"I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation.\"  \"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\"  \"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.\"  \"Farewell, then,\" said the old man solemnly. \"Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine.\" Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.  \"God help us!\" said Holmes after a long silence. \"Why does fate play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter\\'s words, and say, \\'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.\\'\"  James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.       THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS  When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years \\'82 and \\'90, I am faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be, entirely cleared up.  The year \\'87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque \"Sophy Anderson\", of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man\\'s watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.  It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell\\'s fine sea-stories until the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother\\'s, and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.  \"Why,\" said I, glancing up at my companion, \"that was surely the bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\"  \"Except yourself I have none,\" he answered. \"I do not encourage visitors.\"  \"A client, then?\"  \"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady\\'s.\"  Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.  \"Come in!\" said he.  The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.  \"I owe you an apology,\" he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. \"I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.\"  \"Give me your coat and umbrella,\" said Holmes. \"They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from the south-west, I see.\"  \"Yes, from Horsham.\"  \"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive.\"  \"I have come for advice.\"  \"That is easily got.\"  \"And help.\"  \"That is not always so easy.\"  \"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"  \"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\"  \"He said that you could solve anything.\"  \"He said too much.\"  \"That you are never beaten.\"  \"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a woman.\"  \"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"  \"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"  \"Then you may be so with me.\"  \"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case.\"  \"It is no ordinary one.\"  \"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.\"  \"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family.\"  \"You fill me with interest,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important.\"  The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze.  \"My name,\" said he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the affair.  \"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence.  \"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson\\'s army, and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three fields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.  \"He didn\\'t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. With a boy\\'s curiosity I have peeped through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room.  \"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel\\'s plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. \\'From India!\\' said he as he took it up, \\'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?\\' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand, \\'K. K. K.!\\' he shrieked, and then, \\'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!\\'  \"\\'What is it, uncle?\\' I cried.  \"\\'Death,\\' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.  \"\\'They may do what they like, but I\\'ll checkmate them still,\\' said he with an oath. \\'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.\\'  \"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope.  \"\\'I wish you, John,\\' said my uncle, \\'to witness my will. I leave my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can\\'t say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.\\'  \"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.  \"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of \\'suicide.\\' But I, who knew how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed, however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of some Â£14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.\"  \"One moment,\" Holmes interposed, \"your statement is, I foresee, one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his supposed suicide.\"  \"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon the night of May 2nd.\"  \"Thank you. Pray proceed.\"  \"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and \\'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register\\' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle\\'s life in America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the North.  \"Well, it was the beginning of \\'84 when my father came to live at Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January of \\'85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself.  \"\\'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?\\' he stammered.  \"My heart had turned to lead. \\'It is K. K. K.,\\' said I.  \"He looked inside the envelope. \\'So it is,\\' he cried. \\'Here are the very letters. But what is this written above them?\\'  \"\\'Put the papers on the sundial,\\' I read, peeping over his shoulder.  \"\\'What papers? What sundial?\\' he asked.  \"\\'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,\\' said I; \\'but the papers must be those that are destroyed.\\'  \"\\'Pooh!\\' said he, gripping hard at his courage. \\'We are in a civilised land here, and we can\\'t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the thing come from?\\'  \"\\'From Dundee,\\' I answered, glancing at the postmark.  \"\\'Some preposterous practical joke,\\' said he. \\'What have I to do with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.\\'  \"\\'I should certainly speak to the police,\\' I said.  \"\\'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.\\'  \"\\'Then let me do so?\\'  \"\\'No, I forbid you. I won\\'t have a fuss made about such nonsense.\\'  \"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.  \"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of \\'death from accidental causes.\\' Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.  \"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle\\'s life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.  \"It was in January, \\'85, that my poor father met his end, and two years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.\"  The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.  \"This is the envelope,\" he continued. \"The postmark is London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were upon my father\\'s last message: \\'K. K. K.\\'; and then \\'Put the papers on the sundial.\\'\"  \"What have you done?\" asked Holmes.  \"Nothing.\"  \"Nothing?\"  \"To tell the truth\"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--\"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can guard against.\"  \"Tut! tut!\" cried Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.\"  \"I have seen the police.\"  \"Ah!\"  \"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.\"  Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \"Incredible imbecility!\" he cried.  \"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the house with me.\"  \"Has he come with you to-night?\"  \"No. His orders were to stay in the house.\"  Again Holmes raved in the air.  \"Why did you come to me,\" he cried, \"and, above all, why did you not come at once?\"  \"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.\"  \"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which might help us?\"  \"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table. \"I have some remembrance,\" said he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is '"
