Okay first of all I love Oatmeal Raisin cookies and this one was no exception.  It was great!!! Soft n chewy, nice portion size and and as always a high quality product from Quaker Oats.  Thanks to Quaker and Influenster to for including this in their Mom Voxbox.  If you haven't tried it you need to and make sure to share it with the family.\n",

      "I was recently given a complimentary \"vox box\" from influenster, call the mom vox box. It came with various products in it for me to try out and review the products inside. One of the products i received was a Quaker soft baked oatmeal cookie \"raisins\" flavor. When i opened the cookie wrapper, i gave half of it to my 3 year old and i ate the other half. I was immediately surprised by how soft the cookie was when i was splitting it in half. It was like a really really good home baked cookie. Soft, chewy and tasty. I normally do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, due to the raisins, but this cookie was surprisingly yummy. My three year old loved it so much that we had to go out and buy our own box. The cookies are soft, chewy, yummy, and healthier than other kinds of cookies, so  i would definitely recommend this product to people that have kids for a healthy yummy substitute to other sweets\n",

It was soft without being crumbly, moist, and not too dense (some oatmeal cookies are pretty dense). I highly recommend this cookie to anyone thinking of trying it for the first time:)\n",

But both my kids are already huge fans of all things Quaker so it's easy for me to write this review.<br /><br />Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are chewy, nutrition and according to my kids, DELICIOUS.  They are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats, individually packaged at $2.69 for a box of 6, is a good source of fiber, only contains 6 grams of total fat per cookie and sold pretty much EVERYWHERE!\n",
      " \n",
      "I loved this delicious cookie! I even shared it with my 11 month old, and I'm a pretty big health nut when it comes to what I feed my daughter. It tasted great, was a great portion and it's not full of fats and sugars like all of those other cookies!\n",

      "I love oatmeal cookies and have made them at least hundred times.  I love my cookies, but these come in a very close second to my under baked, soft homemade \"vanishing oatmeal\" cookies.<br />There's some ingredients in these cookies that I don't find in my kitchen cabinet, but if you're not against prepackaged food, it shouldn't bother you.<br /><br />I loved the allspice taste, but my guy friend didn't that much.  I think he's just partial to my cookies.  The individual serving size is nice.  I'm more apt to just have one cookie this way rather than opening a whole box and having to eat them before they get stale.  I could say that individually wrapping the cookie saves me from just having one more and one more and..........<br /><br />They are delicious and make me feel like I'm eating something that is somewhat healthy for me.  After all, there is oatmeal in the cookie.\n",
      " \n",
      "I love the soft bakes oatmeal raisin cookies.  The subtle taste of the oatmeal with the natural sweetness of the raisins is wonderful.\n",

      "This was delicious. I was hesitant about trying it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was so delicious and soft. I like my cookies crunchy and well done. Lol When baking my own I usually lightly burn a few for me. But this cookie was so good. I think I will make an exception for the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisins\n",
      " \n",
      "I received a free sample of these cookies through Influenster and immediately got hooked on them. They're are so soft, perfect for anytime but specially for breakfast. My son loved them even though he doesn't like Oatmeal. I had to purchase more and now we treat ourselves every morning to a yummy cookie.\n",
      " \n",
      "I loved the texture, the natural taste, and the softness was just right!!! If you are wanting a good cookie to take o the go, or for anytime, this is a very good choice!!\n",
      " \n",
      "First thought--not as good as homemade.  Second thought--good anyways.  Homemade oatmeal cookies are chewy, moist, a slightly crisp outer layer... but these cookies are cakey throughout.  The other thing that sets them apart from homemade cookies is a slight taste of preservatives--or something--something different and packaged-tasting about the flavor.  They're not too sweet, which I like.  My kids have started revolting against granola bars and protein bars as snacks on our day-trips--I think this would be a good thing to take instead.  Filling, good energy boost, tastes better than an energy bar.\n",
      " \n",
      "These are nice soft, spicy oatmeal cookies with a rich molasses flavor.  They are a perfect single serving size, in a perfect individual wrap.  They have a good taste, natural, not artificial and are a satisfying snack.  I would buy these to take for a snack or lunch.\n",
      " \n",
      "Good store bought cookie comes individually wrapped so every one is fresh.  Has a slightly burnt flavor, the bottoms of the cookies were very dark, almost burnt.  Soft and chewy with a sweet tast, could use more raisins and a stronger oatmeal flavor.  Overall, I liked them and my son loved them.  I guess the younger folks will like how sweet the cookie is.  Not like homemade but very good for store bought.\n",
      " \n",
      "i was surprised i liked it! i normally don't like oatmeal cookies, but these were sooo soft and chewy. it was delicious. i shared one with my daughter and she wolfed it down!\n",
      " \n",
      "Oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite but I do enjoy them from time to time but you would never know it by this cookie.  The first bite was pretty terrible, though they did seem to get better about half way through the cookie.  It was so dry and had a sawdust kind of texture.  I think the problem is the main ingredient is ground up oats, then with whole oats and wheat flour, instead of the recipes I've made with more whole oats and then wheat flour.  Even though I don't really like raisins they were the best thing about these cookies.  At least a bite with a raisin was a tiny bit moister.<br /><br />Not only that but it was 170 for only one cookie.  If this was a diet cookie, maybe I wouldn't be so harsh about the texture, but 170 for one cookie sure isn't diet food.<br /><br />2 stars.\n",
      " \n",
      "WOW, I gave it to my son to try and it was gone within SECONDS. Then he goes, \"Mommy, can I have more?\" and I had to then go out and buy some more of these great cookies. I was very impressed with the packaging and how SOFT the cookies really were when you opened them and the flavor that they had. Very Impressive. Would definitely buy!\n",

      "Quaker products always mean good tasting.  They also mean a healthier option of processed snacks.  Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin Cookies are indeed soft and moist.  Each cookie is over an ounce; a nice size cookie.  You can see the whole oats and raisins.  I can taste the raisins and spices as well.  It is a tasty oatmeal raisin cookie.<br /><br />There are six individually wrapped cookies per box.  I like the individual wrapping as it keeps the cookies fresh and aids with portion control.  Per cookie you are looking at: 170 calories, 6g of fat, 27g carbohydrates, 4 g dietary fiber, 12g sugar, and 2g protein.  The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Nutritional facts are displayed on each individual wrapper as well, so nutrition, ingredient and allergy information is accessible even without the box or the internet.<br /><br />For a convenient, cheaper and healthier option, Quaker's cookies are a good choice.  I recommend these cookies.  I hope to try the chocolate almond flavor next!\n",

      "This is more than just a cookie. It is a guilty pleasure. Except that you dont have to feel guilty because it is good for you. It is so soft and fresh you would think your grandma just baked it. LOVE LOVE LOVE it!\n",

      "I received a sample pack of the Raisin variety of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster to test out with my family.<br /><br />My 22 month old son loved the cookie and almost ate the whole thing himself. I did manage a couple bites and I love the soft, chewy-ness of the cookie. Plus, it provides a good source of fiber, something we don't incorporate enough of in our diets sometimes. I will definitely consider purchasing more of these cookies as a snack for my son!\n",
      " \n",
      "The soft baked cookies are amazingly delicious! Even my children really enjoy them!! I was surprised when they all actually ate it because they never eat anything with raisins in it. This was exciting since I now keeps these with me in case the boys need a snack since they would be able to eat one between the four of them.\n",
      " \n",
      "My kids will devour these cookies. They must be super good because believe it or not my kids are picky cookie eaters. I do not like raisins personally so I haven't tried them myself. My only negative thing I can think of is that they are very crumby because they are soft, so with kids it gets quite messy.\n",

      "Quaker, which knows a thing or two about oats, has put together a pretty nice oatmeal cookie here. The cookie is soft, as advertised, but is NOT pillowy, doughy, gooey or some other displeasing variety of soft. Rather, it just has a nice yielding softness. No doubt related to the consistency, the cookie is not cloyingly sweet. Oh, it's still definitely a cookie - but you're not overwhelmed with a sugar rush. The raisins didn't add a lot of flavor - the ones I encountered weren't large or anything remotely like plump.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like a relatively low-guilt addition to a lunchbox or a desk drawer for snack time. Tasty, soft, and full of oatmealy goodness.\n",

      "In one box you get six cookies, each individually wrapped.  Which is all meant to be quite convenient, I suppose.  Throw one in your child's lunchbox and send him/her off.  Frankly, these cookies are not nearly as delicious as the ones my husband and I make and ours are lower in fat and calories, with fewer additives.  In other words, healthier.<br /><br />But \"healthier\" isn't why most people buy pre-made food products and these cookies taste good enough.  I love oatmeal raisin cookies and I wasn't disappointed by these enough to dislike them.  However, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004L5UD2K\">Grandma's Homestyle Oatmeal Raisin Big Cookie, 2.5 Oz Bag (Pack of 20)</a> are lower in calories and have the same amount of fat, per cookie.  (Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging.\n",

      "Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies (raisin) fail the most important test of a cookie.  They are not delicious.  Considering they're 170 calories for ONE cookie you'd expect something decadent.  It's not even as tasty as an average cookie.<br /><br />A little bit dry considering it's supposed to be soft, moist cookie.  A slight sandy or grainy texture.  There's nothing foul or obnoxious about the taste - it's just nothing special.<br /><br />Nutritionally - ok for a cookie.  170 calories, 1.5g sat fat.  4g fiber!  (quite a bit.)  But I don't look at a cookie as some sort of health food.  A big* cookie like this should be an indulgence - a treat.  Instead it's not abhorrent.  If you start eating this, you'll finish it.  But you won't go out of your way for another one.<br /><br />*not THAT big.  It's not like a famous amos or something.\n",

There was the perfect combination of oatmeal to raisin, and I didn't feel like I was tasting cardboard, as I tend to with oatmeal cookies.

      "Generally, these Quaker oatmeal cookies were a disappointment.  The major positive is that the first ingredient listed is whole grain oat flour.  Other pluses are that the cookie is not particularly sweet, individually wrapped, and it is soft, but not crumbly.  My husband and I tried these cookies for dessert last night.  The first issue was that they are 170 calories each, meaning we only had one, even though their size is not particularly large, around 3 inches in diameter.  Second, the overall taste and texture impression of the cookie is that it is commercially made; it will not remotely remind you of homemade.  Third, and personally, there are not enough raisins.  Finally, both of us noticed the cinnamon flavoring, which was border line too much; the ingredients list indicates allspice as well.  The only \"fortifications\" to the cookie are calcium (4%) and iron (8%).\n",
      " \n",
      "These cookies are alright, except that once you are finished you may notice an aftertaste and I think this is due to the cookies containing too much allspice.  The cookies also contain cinnamon, which does not leave an aftertaste.\n",

      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie was given to me to sample through Influenster Mom Vox box program.  It tasted like it was home baked.  I did notice it was a little heavy in the cinnamon department, so if you don't like cinnamon or if you have an allergy to it, then this would not be a good cookie for you.  This was shared with my 14 year old daughter that gave her seal of approval, too.\n",

They are soft but not crumbly, easy to eat not to chewy, they are filling and satsfying.\n",

      "I'm not a fan of oatmeal or raisins (lol) but I wanted to taste the cookie before I gave it to my daughter. So I'll give my review based on how well she liked it. The cookie was extremely fresh when I opened it. My daughter ate about half of the cookie before putting the pack down. So I'll take that as she was somewhat satisfied because if she doesn't like it, she throws it aways and if she really likes it she'll eat it all! Ha! I am interested in finding out what other types of cookies are available because it is a more healthier alternative versus her eating chips or candy.<br /><br />**NOTE: In my review, I only took into account my thoughts on the cookie itself.  But if I had to grade this with the price that Amazon has it for, I would probably give it 1 star!  A 6-pack of these cookies is $2.69 so why is a 12-pack almost $35 on here?! Am I missing something, lol**\n",

When I got the chance to sample Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins, I said \"Why not?\"  The cookies come 6 to a box and are individually wrapped.  They are pleasant soft oatmeal with a balanced blend of spices and raisins.  I would have liked more raisins.  They were also very soft almost, as another reviewer mentioned...powdery.  They did have a good taste and they are very convenient (good for lunches, tucked in a backpack or desk drawer) and I found them very filling/satisfying.  But, for me, they were just a bit off mark.  I guess I expected a soft oatmeal cookie to be a bit more solid and chewy.  I will buy them occasionally if I have a specific need for something quick and easy.\n",

      "QUAKER SOFT BAKED OATMEAL COOKIES RAISINS is a product consisting of a box of six cookies.  Each of the six cookies is enclosed in a sturdy plastic envelope, with a tooth-edge at the top and bottom, suitable for grasping and for tearing open the envelope.  On the plus side, all of the cookies were intact, despite shipping.  The intact nature of the cookies was largely due to the fact that they are soft (not crunchy) and secondarily due to the secure packaging.  The cookies were bland and unadventuresome, both in taste and in texture.  Although the photographs on the cardboard box and on the plastic envelope show cookies having a surface dotted withabout 12 whole raisins, it was the case that the actual cookie contains a scattering of chopped raisin bits inside.  Therefore, the consumer should not expect to be treated to a cookies bearing a cargo of plump, juicy raisins.  In paying attention to the flavor, I noticed that the cookies had a detectable raisin flavor.  Also on the plus side, in knowing (from first-hand experience) that hard oatmeal can get wedged in between fillings, resulting in damage to teeth and fillings, the older consumer will be pleased that this QUAKER product is totally inocuous, as far as dental work is concerned.  These cookies are, indeed, sooooooft!<br /><br />Ordinary oatmeal has about 61 grams carbohydrate, 12 grams protein, and 7 grams fat, per 100 grams of oatmeal (Pomeranz (1987) Modern Cereal Science and Technology (pages 350-370)).  The NUTRITION FACTS label that this QUAKER product shows that the breakdown is as follows.  Each QUAKER cookie (42 grams) contains 27 grams carbohydrate, 6 grams of fat, and only 2 grams of protein.  Hence, it can be seen, that the cookies, as compared to straight oatmeal, is somewhat low in protein.  The low protein content should not be a concern to most adults, because growth, and the issue of acquiring the proper nutrient balance to sustain growth, is generally relevant only during pregnancy and lactation, and for growing children.  If any conclusion can be made regarding this fine product, is that it could be a preferred snack food for adults who have had multiple dental fillings, and need to worry about dental damage.  Although this cookie is fine for children, please remember that much better sources of protein are available, e.g., milk, cheese, meat, fish, poultry, tofu, and legumes (peas, beans, lentils).\n",

      "I love homemade oatmeal raisin cookies, the kind that are a little chewy, made with lots of oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, and not too many raisins.  So I was skeptical of this soft, \"store bought\" cookie.  I assumed it would be, well, bad.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's made with whole grains, which imbues each cookie with 16% of daily fiber recommendations.  It was indeed soft, but it didn't seem artificially so, more like it was just cooled down from the oven.<br /><br />As I began my 'taste test', I appreciated the fact that the cookies are individually wrapped, which allows for easy transport in lunches or purses.  I took a small bite at first, because I was already prepared to be disappointed.  As that bite went down, I reached for another.  Then another.  Very tasty, as it turned out!  Soon the cookie was gone and I realized I wanted another one!  However, at 170 calories each, these are NOT \"low calorie\", they're just made with better ingredients than most.<br /><br />As for other nutrition information (other than the fiber and calorie count mentioned above), each cookie has 150 milligrams of sodium, so not too bad there.  You'll find 4% of calcium and 8% of iron (recommended daily requirements).<br /><br />The first ingredient is whole grain oat flour.  Sugar is about number 10 or so on the ingredient list.  One quibble I have is that the list of ingredients is rather lengthy.  My nutritionist has advised me to watch for products with what seem like extraordinarily long ingredient lists, probably means there's lots of stuff in there that's not exactly \"good\" for us, but it is what it is:  a factory-made, store-bought cookie that's got a pretty long list of ingredients and shelf life that don't come naturally to \"homemade cookies\".  Just accept it for what it is, a decent, convenient mass-produced cookie.\n",
      " \n",
      "The folks at Quaker really got the soft texture here, and the individual packages keep the cookies very soft and fresh.<br /><br />I would have liked more raisins, I couldn't hear \"it thru the grapevine\".<br /><br />Good nutrition for a cookie.\n",
      " \n",
      "Taste: I thought these did a good job of mimicking the taste of home made cookies. Cinnamony and raisiny (though the raisins aren't big plump raisins...they're more suggestions of raisins...and they are sweetened by sugar and fructose NOT HFCS.<br /><br />Mouth feel: When Mom makes oatmeal cookies, you can feel the oat meal (usually) when you are chewing. This doesn't have that. The oats are milled to the point where the flavour is there but the texture is not. If this is a problem for you, you might want to pass. Other than that, it's probably a good idea to have a glass of milk handy. They are \"moist\" in that they aren't crunchy...but they verge on dry.<br /><br />Value: On Amazon, the cookies come to about .50$ a piece. Which is comparable to my local grocery.<br /><br />A good all around (large) cookie and I think I will try the other varieties...you should too!\n",

      "The box says, \"soft baked oatmeal cookies\" and that is exactly what you get!  The cookies are individually packed, which makes it easy to grab for lunches, or to throw in a purse or backback for \"on the go\" kids.  The cookies are fairly good sized, and packed with raisins.  I was concerned about an aftertaste that I have sometimes noticed with cookies that are pre-packaged (maybe a preservative that is often used?) but I did not notice any funny taste or smell to these cookies.  In fact, I could not find anything I was unhappy with!\n",

      "Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite. Quaker Oats has done these well with this new product. The strongest flavor to come off is, perhaps surprisingly, cinnamon. It's a very strong taste at the tip of your tongue. The cookie also does have enough raisins for it to qualify as oatmeal raisin, which was something I was concerned about at first.<br /><br />The cookie is very soft and still tastes pretty fresh, even after all the packing and processing that obviously went into it. They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear. Overall, this is a good choice if you want cheap, store-bought oatmeal cookies.\n",

      "Quick breakdown of the cost.  For $34.71 you got 12 boxes of 6 cookies.  That's about $2.90 a box, and 49 cents per cookie.  NOT too bad.<br /><br />Taste-This is a denser cookie than I usually enjoy, especially when it comes to my oatmeal raisin.  (My favorite cookie, by the way!)  It almost has a cake like consistency, and while it isn't the type of cookie I would munch on at home while I watch a Blu-Ray, this is the type of snack I would buy for road trips or picnics.  There is a hint of brown sugar, not overwhelming, but enough that my little ones (8 and 4) remarked that they liked the sweetness of it.  My oldest, wished there were more raisins, and I would have to agree with that as well.  But I liked the whole grains. Overall, it is good, but a bit dry.<br /><br />Size-this is a larger cookie, similar to what you would get in say Subway or Starbucks.  Not overly huge, but not too small either.  I think this is a perfect snack size.<br /><br />Nutrition-at 170 calories it isn't a lightweight, but nor is it overly fattening either.  6 Grams of fat, 1.5 grams of Saturated (NOT horrific), but it has some Polyunsaturated and 3.5 grams of Monounsaturated=the 'good' kind of fat.  4 grams of fiber, good in a snack like this, but only 2 grams a protein, wish there was more.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't a snack I would buy on a regular basis.  Maybe once in awhile for school lunches, and I would certainly get this for a road trip, or a hike.  Compared to many other snacks like this, it is a decent value for the money, and if you enjoy a thicker cookie, this is right up your alley!\n",

      "These cookies are soft and chewy and the real raisins add a nice touch.  While they are 170 calories per cookie, the good taste makes them worth it.  They are also individually wrapped which makes them easy to add to a packed lunch.  They are almost as good as mom used to make!\n",

      "I sampled this product for the Influenster Mom Vox Box that I received in the mail.  I am purchase Quaker cereals on a regular basis and was excited to try this cookie.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the cookie and felt it stayed true to the Quaker brand.  I did not like the fact there were so many preservatives in the cookie like TBHQ and BHT.  For those reasons I will not be purchasing this on a regular basis.\n",

I don't like raisins so I gave most of it to my kiddos.  I did take a taste though and it was delicious.  A lot of store bought oatmeal cookies don't taste good at all but this was so good.  You could see the oats and everything.  What a great special treat to have with whole grains to get that extra fiber we all need.  I can't wait to go and buy some in a different flavor.  :)\n",

I had to split it because the package only had one cookie in it. My daughter devoured it, my son...he saw there were raisin's in it and freaked out. K ended up eating her brother's half as well. I was bugged for days by her for another cookie so she must have loved it since that's how 3yr olds express love for food! (I WANT MORE COOKIE!)<br />I didn't get a chance to personally try the cookie, but over all it seemed good and from a brand that I like and trust, it also smelled pretty yummy!\n",

The cookie was moist, soft, chewy... everything an oatmeal raisin cookie should be.  The taste was superb - just the right amount of cinnamon & nutmeg - and it was super filling and held me over perfectly until dinner time.  When I tried them out, I was 8 months pregnant and constantly hungry, so for a cookie to be able to hold me over for that long... color me impressed!\n",

My son has taken them to school for an after school quick bite before sports, and i love to have them at work in case I am starving and know lunch is getting pushed back in the day. They are really great, and if you have tried their oatmeal breakfast bars these are kinda like them, but not as heavy!!\n",
      " \n",
      "Quaker always has high quality products. I like these cookies. They have a great texture and great taste. And they are a good size.  Individually wrapped in foil packets for freshness. Good taste with a nice hint of cinnamon. If you like cinnamon you will love these cookies.\n",
      " \n",
      "These cookies taste really good.  The only oatmeal cookies I like better are the chewy ones made with more sugar (carmelization!).<br /><br />Given the moderate (12g) amount of sugar in these, they taste great, and actually make sense as an energy snack.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Fiber!  4g per cookie.<br />- Nutrition: Easy on the fats and sugars.<br />- Soft, semi-chewy texture.  Raisins are just chewy enough.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />None really.<br /><br />Individual packaging is nice for taking them with you.  Always like to see less packaging but these aren't too wasteful on materials.<br /><br />Recommended.\n",

      "I am a cookie lover, so I was excited to get to try this product for free through the Amazon Vine program.  Unfortunately, these are just not very good.<br /><br />They are too crumbly, almost powdery, as if maybe they weren't baked enough.  The flavor is okay, but certainly nothing special.  They are soft, but the texture is not pleasant.<br /><br />They remind me of \"Grandma's Cookies\".  Except they are about half as good.\n",
      " \n",
      "These are a very filling and great tasting.  As a quick snack, when you don't have time for a meal, or a super simple quickie breakfast; these are a very good option.  I highly recommend them.\n",
      " \n",
      "My cookie-hound husband was into them almost before they were out of the mailbox.  The quality and taste are very much the same as Archway brand; that is a good thing as I consider them to be the best store-bought cookie out there.  My husband would have liked more whole oats in the mix, but understands that too few people appreciate texture in their food.<br /><br />The individual wrapping might be nice for kids' lunches but is an expensive and unecological waste for the (typical) case that a group will be eating them and/or individuals will eat more than one.  At the very, very, least wrap them two-at-a time?<br /><br />If they're priced similarly to Archway, I would expect them to do at least as well as the equivalent Archway cookies.\n",
      " \n",
      "These individually sealed oatmeal raisin cookies are tasty, and soft, but a bit dry. They need to be a little more moist, especially since the whole point of cookies in individual foil wrappers is to protect moisture. The taste is traditional cinnamon raisin, and the taste is fine, but in this crowded market, with many competitors, Quaker cannot afford for the cookies not to be perfectly moist.<br /><br />I remember back when the Quaker Oats came in a round, cardboard container. On the side of that container was a recipe for oatmeal cookies, which my mom used to make frequently. Those cookies, with Nestle's chocolate chips added, were the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I ever tasted. Now, if Quaker could market those cookies and make 'em taste as good as mom's, then they'd have something.\n",

      "They're cookies so they're not just terrible, but I've had lots better soft-baked cookies than these.  They are pretty bland, just a mild raisiny sweetness and the texture is dry and crumbly and turns a little mealy upon chewing.  I tried them in coffee and in milk to see if they were better that way and while the taste was a little better the texture just became wet and mealy and bits fell off into my coffee.  A soft cookie can definitely be moist, hold up to milk and have a bit of chew to it.  Pepperidge Farm makes an addictive soft baked oatmeal cookie.\n",
      " \n",
      "One star for being soft. One for having oatmeal. One for having raisins. But that's it. These cookies taste fine, but they are pretty dry and fairly crumbly. Not overly enjoyable. They'd be fine dunked in milk or something, but I'd be afraid half of it would fall into the glass. Little Debbie and Pepperidge Farms have both proven that you can sell packaged, soft-baked cookies that are still moist. Plus, these seem over-packaged. Individually wrapped cookies? Okay, yeah it's handy for a packed lunch or something, but really? That seems excessive. I'd probably skip these.\n",
      " \n",
      "This is a great product. Moist flavorful cookie that is packaged nicely so you can take it on the go. This is a great to go breakfast or a snack anytime of the day.\n",

      "Tasty cookie!  It was soft, though maybe just a little dry.  The raisins were actually nice and juicy, not all dried up like in most packaged cookies.  Pretty good overall.\n",
      " \n",
      "This cookie is big enough to share! I love the taste this cookie is more on the dry side not so much chewy so if you like the harder drier cookies this is for you!\n",

      "I received this product free to test from Influenster.com and couldnt have been more excited to try.  I love soft baked cookies, but I find that whenever i try to buy ones that are already made, they don't taste fresh.  The Quaker Soft Baked Cookie is large and fulfilling.  The taste was fresh as though it had been made right in your own kitchen.  My kids loved the oatmeal raisin and it had just the right amount of raisins in it.  This will be the ONLY type of soft cookie I will buy from here on out!  I love the quality of Quaker products!\n",

She loved them so much she asked to buy her more every time we go to the store!!! I was very impressed!\n",

As I was going through all the products I was sent to test I opened the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal cookie and ate it. I was pleasantly surprised. I have not eaten an Oatmeal cookie since I was a kid.  Taking that first bite brought me right back to my childhood where my mom would bake oatmeal cookies for my grade school parties.  The Quaker cookie is very soft and has just the right amount of raisins.  The raisins do not take away from the taste of the oatmeal. I have already bought two boxes of these and will continue to add these cookies to my bi-monthly grocery lists.  Try these cookies you will not regret it!!\n",

I received the oatmeal raisin cookie, I'm not a fan of raisins but I was willing to give the cookie a try just based on the amazing smell. When I took my first bite I was in love, the cookie was soft and moist and when it was gone I found myself wanting more. I totally recommend people try this amazing cookie for themselves.\n",

I shared the original cookie with my 3yo daughter and husband both of whom enjoyed it also. I actually ended up buying a box the next time we went grocery shopping.<br />The flavor of these is quite nice and the cookies are large and soft. I was impressed with the fact that they're moderately healthy and liked that they weren't too sweet.<br />The cookies are a bit expensive, and I'd prefer to make my own to have more control over the ingredients, but they are a good shopping choice. They're great for short trips or an emergency snack. I'd definitely buy more of them, but not on a weekly basis.\n",

I'm already a huge fan of almost all Quaker products, and these cookies didn't disappoint. They're SUPER soft, and weren't dry whatsoever!!! The oatmeal cookie part has a great flavor, no weird aftertaste like some cookies do. The raisins were decent, nice and plump, juicy, didn't have the dried out look, and there were enough of them in the cookies, but not too many (meaning the kids will still eat them, lol). They were good sized cookies, individually wrapped to ensure freshness, and had a delicious taste. Now I'm craving them! Overall, they were a great cookie! I'd definitely purchase them again. Can't wait til they're back in stock on Amazon!\n",

As such, I was somewhat skeptical of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies, as I'm generally let down by store-bought cookies. Well, I'm here to tell you, I have become a believer. I have seen the light! Here's a breakdown of what I think overall:<br /><br />TEXTURE:<br />The package says \"soft-baked,\" and brother, it is no lie. These cookies are soft, moist and chewy, thus negating the need to do the milk dunk. Though, ice cold milk is a requisite with cookies, regardless.<br /><br />SERVING SIZE:<br />At 42g, these cookies are pretty well-sized and will definitely satisfy even the hardiest of sugar seekers. It would take 3 Oreos to match the size of one oatmeal raisin. No contest.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Dynamite. Sweet cinnamon and raisins definitely prevail in this recipe, giving the oatmeal an authentic, homemade flavor.<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL PROFILE:<br />Now, this is where Quaker loses a few points with me. Though certainly not the unhealthiest cookie out there (in fact, it's probably on the healthier end of the spectrum), there are a few select ingredients that could be avoided, such as corn syrup. But, each cookie does contain 4g of fiber, as well as several grams of healthy fats, and 2g protein! For those who are curious, here's the complete nutrient breakdown:<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Cookie (42g)<br />Calories: 140<br />Total Fat: 6g (9%)<br />Saturated Fat: 1.5g (8%)<br />Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g<br />Monounsaturated Fat: 3.5g<br />Cholesterol: 15mg (5%)<br />Sodium: 150mg (6%)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 27g (9%)<br />Dietary Fiber: 4g (16%)<br />Sugars: 12g<br />Other Carbohydrate: 11g<br />Protein: 2g<br /><br />Ingredients: Whole Grain Oat Flour, Enriched Flour (Bleached and Unbleached Wheat Flour, Niacin, Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid), Raisins, Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Whole Wheat Flour, Palm and High Oleic Canola Oil (with TBHQ [preservative]), Fructose, Invert Sugar Syrup, Mid-Oleic Sunflower Oil, Raisin Paste, Inulin, Granola (Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil*, Honey, Brown Sugar Molasses), Dried Eggs, Modified Corn Starch, Corn Syrup, Polydextrose, Leavening Agents (Sodium Bicarbonate, Ammonium Bicarbonate), Oat Fiber, Propylene Glycol Mono- and Diesters of Fat and Fatty Acids, Mono- and Diglycerides, Soy Lecithin, BHT [to preserve freshness], Citric Acid [to preserve freshness], Wheat Gluten, Molasses, Calcium Phosphate, Salt, Natural Flavor, Cinnamon, Allspice, Corn Starch, Enzymes. *Adds a Dietarily Insignificant Amount of Trans Fat<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Stellar! Each cookie is individually wrapped for easy travel and consumption, so parents can toss one in their kid's lunch box, or tote one to the office for an easy snack/dessert.<br /><br />COST:<br />From what I can tell, the Quaker cookies are about par for the course in terms of cost, neither on the high nor low end, making for a pretty economical choice. Based on Amazon's pricing as I write this, the cost is slightly less than $1.00 per cookie. Not bad!<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />If you're looking to indulge in something sweet, somewhat healthy, and reminds you of a homemade treat, you can't do much better than Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies. The only challenge will be trying to resist a second helping, especially if you still have ice cold milk remaining in your glass.\n",

      "My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with.\n",

      "This is a must have for those sweet tooth cravings. My youngest child is 6 and isn't much of a sweets eater. However, he found the sample I received from Influenster and he LOVED it! I have to say, I was a tad disappointed that he didn't save me any but he assured me it was \"yummy\" Will definitely keep these on stock.\n",

      "I received the Quaker oatmeal raisin cookie as part of my Mom voxbox from Influenster.com. It was the first thing I took out of the box because I was hungry. I was honestly expecting not to like it. When I first opened the bag it smelled very fresh. I took a bite of it and instantly loved it. I loved how fresh, soft and chewy the cookie was. I went out and bought more so my husband can also have some, he also loved them. They are a great on the go snack.\n",

      "Good oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />You can pretend you're eating something healthy.  When your marathoner, vegan, 4% body-fat co-worker says, \"Cookies?\" in their smug, disdainful fashion, you can reply, \"No, it's oatmeal\".  Then cram another seven in your mouth, 'cause these are *really* good cookies.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court\n",

Their good, tasty, and it's easy to eat when your busy in the morning or you just need a quick snack. You can even heat these up a bit in the microwave or have them cold, it's great either way. But the one complaint I have of these are the raisins, I don't know they just didn't taste that great and they kept getting stuck everywhere my mouth.Glad I tried them though!!\n",

      "Three years ago I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. It sucked. There's nothing like bring in the middle of the ravenousness of pregnancy and being told to watch what you eat. But it did get me to start paying better attention to how I could still enjoy foods I loved while making healthier choices. One of the things I learned to balance was fiber intake. Ever since I've made a point to always go for whole grains when the choice is available and Quaker's products tend to make the best of combining deliciousness with heart-healthy oats.<br /><br />I recently received a sample of these Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster and they're surprisingly good. Maybe not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was a kid but still a tasty treat reminiscent of the childhood classic. Packed with raisins and big enough you only need one they're a satisfying snack or dessert option. Since traditional oatmeal cookies aren't my favorite I'm going to have to try one of their other flavors like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMH96\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JFMHBE\">Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Cranberry and Yogurt, 8.8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>.

While both are good, I'm a big fan of the chewy cookies. I love oatmeal, but it's not very portable. These are a great cookie to snack on during the mornings or afternoon.\n",

      "I received a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie to test from Influenster via the Mom VoxBox. My 3 year old son loved the cookie - each cookie is pretty large, very soft and full of raisins. If you buy a package of 6, they are individually wrapped which is great for travel. It is great that they are made with whole grain Quaker oats - and that they have a nice helping of raisins. They are still a cookie though and have 12 grams of sugar per cookie. I did buy a box for my son for an occasional treat.\n",
      " \n",
      "I recieved one of these to try out in my Influenster Mom Vox Box. I am not a huge raisin fan but I really enjoyed this cookie. So I was happy to see that the cookie didn't have too many raisins in it but enough to get some in every bite and still be able to taste the cookie. Most oatmeal cookies leave a thick,dry feeling in your mouth but nothing like that with this one, perhaps because it was so soft and chewy. They are on my list to buy again. The cookie was super soft, great for my 1 year old to eat. It was also big enough that I could split it between both kids. I would suggest these to anyone looking for a delicious cookie.\n",

I was one of the lucky ones to receive a Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012 (complimentary for testing and review purposes from Influenster). The Voxbox comes with several items and one of the items was a Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie. It tasted like a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie. The raisins, the oats and you could even taste the cinnamon that's in the cookie. It was so delicious, even my kids loved it! I have 4 kids: 2 year old, 3 year old, 6 year old and a 11 year old and they all enjoyed a piece of the cookie. The little ones even started crying when it was all done. So that definitely means I have to go out and buy some more.\n",

They are soft and chewy like the name says.<br /><br />The Final Say: I have bought them for my family and my little one loves them. We talk them every where. They are about 3$ for a box of 6. All in all i give these 5 (*****). Ill keep buying them for the family. So go get some for yourself!!\n",

Which is good because my kids only half finish what they start eating. I thought it was a great tasting oatmeal cookie - just better without the raisins. I'm not big on them but I was able to pick them out. They need these just in oatmeal with no other ingredient - like raisins added.\n",

Usually you get cookies like this and they are either hard or dry, and that was not the case with Quaker Brand. I'm not a big fan of raisins but they were fine in this cookie. Just the right amount and not over powering.<br /><br />This is one cookie I would purchase on my own, and I'm sure my son will be very happy about it.\n",

      " \n",
      "Normally I'm not a fan of any cookie (other than Oreo) unless its right out of the oven. To me there's just that something extra when it's nice and hot. I took one bit of this thinking I'd be giving the rest of it to my 2 year old daughter. It was DELICIOUS!!! Needless to say, she didn't get any of the cookie. :o) Highly recommend and I will definitely be buying this again!!\n",

      "The Quaker Cookie, was a great soft cookie to eat. My 3 years old daughter really enjoyed the treat! It was soft, there wasn't any after taste to the cookie.. Just all the yummy goodness.. We tried the Oatmeal raisin cookie and the raisin's were good, they were soft not hard..  Overall I would definitely would buy the Quaker Cookies again.. and would definitely buy another kind other than raisin as well.. I think YOU should try it out. :)\n",

Great snack for on the go or to enjoy at home with a nice glass of cold milk.<br /><br /> This cookie is large enough to share with two if you have little ones.  The added bonus is its nutritional value!  Grab a box and enjoy!\n",

      "This cookie was great. It was a little soft, but that's what made it even better. It didn't take long for it to vanish, which might be a bad thing if you lack self control (something I do not possess). I recommend these to everyone unless you are allergic to raisins.\n",

I was so disappointed but from what I understand from him it is one of the best cookies he has ever had, and it tastes better than the cookies I bake him at home.\n",

      "Quaker Oats Company has been around for over 100 years, and with a track record like that you know that they are doing something right! These soft oatmeal raisin cookies are actually quite good. Each cookie weighs about 1.48 ounces, and is about 170 calories (27 grams of carbohydrates). So, while they are not exactly a low-calorie snack, they aren't too bad either.<br /><br />The nice thing about them is that they are nicely filling, making them a nice afternoon snack, when you need a little something to get you through work. And, while oatmeal raisin cookies are not my favorite snack, I did find these to be quite good. As a matter of fact, that's what I like about them being singly packaged, it keeps me from going back for more!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins)\n",
      " \n",
      "No-one should do oatmeal better than Quaker ....right? Well they have been trying to expand from just the basic oatmeal for some time. These soft cookies are tasty and satisfying. In my family you can tell how good they are by how quickly they disappear. Weel - they disappeared in swift order. In fact I barely got to taste more than one. The general consensus is these are 'just like homemade. There is not greater compliment that can be paid. They are packaged conveniently for inclusion in school lunches etc. They certainly make a great accompaniment for tea or coffee for that unwinding moment all of us need at somour day.\n",
      " \n",
      "These cookies are much closer to homemade than most of those break-and-bake cookies out there, with similar nutritional info. Very soft, with lots of plump raisins, great on the go!\n",
      " \n",
      "I like oatmeal and raisin cookies but I don't eat them very often.  That's probably because my wife makes such awesome chocolate cookies.  When I do get an opportunity to try an oatmeal and raisin cookie it is usually from a store-bought package.  I usually come away impressed with how moist these pre-packaged cookies are.  That's what surprised me most about Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie;  They're soft but they aren't moist.  There is a distinct soft dryness to the cookies. The taste was good and my grand daughter quickly ate up most of them.  She liked them because they are tasty and soft.  I agree and I guess two out of three criteria is good but I was looking for one more quality\n",
      " \n",
      "Maybe it was the hot weather? Maybe it was the baking process?<br /><br />These cookies, although individually packed (so good for school lunches), came out a bit dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Sure, maybe I am just a messy eater but a soft baked cookie just not crumble as much as the cookies I got crumbled.<br /><br />Maybe if you get them at the supermarket they would be less dry.<br /><br />Maybe if is just a general problem with the way they are produced.\n",
      " \n",
      "These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products.\n",
      " \n",
      "I really liked these cookies. They are sort of firm but not crunchy, so they don't get crumbs everywhere. They worked really well for me as a post breakfast snack (or sadly even breakfast on some days).  They aren't coated in sugar the way a lot of prepackaged oatmeal cookies are.  Each cookie is individually packaged and is easy to open on the go.<br /><br />I'd totally buy these the next time I see them in the store.\n",
      " \n",
      "Quaker is pretty much the oatmeal company, and they have done a nice job with this oatmeal raisin cookie. I liked the convenience of being individually wrapped, which also preserves its freshness. I take one of these along during a round of golf and in my lunch. The cookie is tasty, light and moist. I recommend this to all cookie lovers, especially those fond of oatmeal raisin.\n",
      " \n",
      "These large cookies greatly resemble in look and taste the ones you might get in a vending machine.  They are individually packaged and have a soft and chewy texture.  The taste left me pretty unsatisfied as they were pretty bland and tasted too \"processed,\" not like simple and fresh oatmeal raisin cookies.  I would not recommend them personally, although my little ones liked them fine (although I rarely know kids to say \"no\" to a cookie!).\n",
      " \n",
      "I got to this in my Mom VoxBox from Influenster. I don't like oatmeal cookies. So I had my daughter try it and she LOVED it. She said \"Mom, this cookie is really good. Is there another one. I only got one.\" I told her no that, that was all. She was really bummed. But I told her that when we go to the store and if we see them we'll make sure to buy them since she likes them so much.\n",
      " \n",
      "Cookies are delicious and very soft, i expected a much different taste but to my surpise they were actually great. I got a sample so i will be purchasing these for my family soon.\n",

      "I was really excited to get this Quaker Soft Baked Cookie in the Oatmeal raisin flavor because this is one of my favorite flavors. Over all the flavor was fabulous with just the right amount of raisins, but I found it to be toooo soft. I do like soft cookies but I had a hard time eating this cookie because it was so soft it crumbled in my fingertips as I tried to take bites so I had to eat it over the wrapper carefully. I also let my 7 year old son and my 12 year old daughter try bites and they loved it and did not care that it was soft and crumbly at all. Overall I would recommend trying them because the flavor is good and maybe they are not all that soft.\n",

      "I recently tried them and they are chewy goodness!  Be sure to try them heat them up, oh your going to love them/\n",

      "I recently tried this cookie as part of an Influenster Mom Vox Box.  Influenster sends out free boxes of products in order for you to test them and give them your feedback. I really enjoyed this cookie!  Most packaged cookies are hard and taste like cardboard but I was pleasantly surprised that this cookie was soft and comparable to a homemade oatmeal raisin cookie.  The nutritional facts weren't too bad for a dessert too.  It was very yummy and filling.  A good sized cookie!  I will definitely be buying some for my family, since I ate this one myself ;)\n",
      " \n",
      "I received a free cookie from Influenster, and it made my week. I normally avoid packaged cookies because I like the chewy freshness of homemade so much better. These had an amazing flavor of cinnamon and spice, and the texture was perfect. I need to go get my own box!\n",
      " \n",
      "I was given a sample of these Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies from Influenster.com as part of their Mom VoxBox 2012 for reviewing. I shared my cookie with my 2 1/2 year old daughter. As with any cookie, she loved it! I thought the cookie was delicious. Not overly sweet, but had perfect flavor. It was moist too, unlike some cookies that are dry. My least favorite part was how crumbly it was. It did have a tendancy to crumble quite a bit. Overall, it was a great cookie.\n",
      " \n",
      "I received this delicious treat complimentary of Influenster in my Mom voxbox. I did note that was in several crumbly pieces when I opened the package, but it obviously didn't change the taste of the cookie itself. It just made it a little messy to eat, but in my house with a toddler that is nothing new. Speaking of toddler, SHE LOVED IT! She actually wanted more after the package was empty, and was pretty upset when I kept telling her it was all gone. :) Looks like we'll be getting some more to have around the house and maybe a little bribery for the diaper bag. :)\n",

I will definitely be buying more, especially now that I know they come in these amazing flavors!! Yummy! They are great to have on the go and especially delicious warmed up with some milk!!  And they are not too expensive on the calorie bank either!\n",
      " \n",
      "I tried these cookies as a sample from influnster.com. They are a little sweet for my taste, the kids loved it. They are a good size, about the size of the palm of my hand. At 170 calories each, they are a little hefty to have more than one at a time, but since they are individually wrapped, no worries about waste.  Try them microwaved for about 20 seconds!\n",
      " \n",
      "I received a cookie as part of an Influenster review. I love that it tastes like a fresh cookie from Grandma's oven. I knew I would love it, but was uber pleased to see that my 2 year old loves it as well. This is definitely something that will replace a fruit snack!\n",

      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious, I received a complimentary sample from Influencers to try the product and review it.  Well when the Vox Box that contained my complimentary products to try I opened it up infront of the mailbox, on the way up my driveway I ate my cookie.  I absolutely love that these are individually packaged yet a nice size cookie.  You don't feel deprived by throwing just one in your lunch box or purse, and certainly the kids love them.  I think they are very reasonably priced, and plan to stock up on a few boxes.  Perfect for the the beach when you want snacks yet don't want the seagulls attacking open food bags.  Not to mention they are a guilt free snack:<br /><br />-Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats<br />-Individually packaged<br />-Provides a good source of fiber<br />-Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving<br /><br />Definite buy, if on sale stock up.\n",

      "I recieve sample of this cookie from Influenster to try out. I normally dislike cookie with raisins but this one was good. I will not get these again but thats not because it wasn't a good cookie its because of the raisins. I will how ever try these in other flavors.\n",
      " \n",
      "I love these cookies. They have a wonderful chewy texture, a bursting with raisins and taste truly homemade. At first I was concerned the cookies may have picked up some of the flavor from the packaging, but the flavor, while helping to maintain the freshness of the cookies, had  no effect on the flavor. I love the baked through flavor of the cookies, they baked to perfection - not underbaked and certainly not overbaked because they are nice and chewy. I will definitely consider these cookies as a pantry item for when I need a treat, but did not have time to  bake cookies for the kids myself.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a Mom Voxbox through Influenster, which contained a sample of Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. The opinion expressed herein are my own personal opinion and have not been influenced by Influenster or any other third party.\n",

      "I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a Quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there.\n",

We'll certainly be buying a box to keep for when it's just too hot to turn on the oven and make our own!\n",

      "Upon recieving this cookie in my voxbox from influenster I sceptical because you expect cookies in a package to be very dry and more often than not tasteless, the cookie recieved in the package was surprisingly moist and very flavorful, it tasted very good and I will definately purchase them in the future.\n",
      " \n",
      "My daughter and I tried the soft baked oatmeal cookies and we both agreed it's delicious!  I rarely purchase premade cookies, because they are too hard for my preference, but this changes my mind.  They are full of flavor.  The oatmeal doesn't overpower the raisins and the raisins don't overpower the oatmeal, it's a perfect balance.  The raisin were soft, not hard like other brands we've tried in the past.  The price for the quality is well worth it.\n",
      " \n",
      "I absolutely fell in love with these cookies.  I love my cookies soft and not hard, unless it's an Oreo and then I soften it in milk, but these cookies are hands down the closest I've had to homemade!\n",
      " \n",
      "Less calories than a candy bar! I will take it. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the cookie. I thought it wouldn't have much flavor but it does. The spice of the cookie and the raisins make it a delicious treat. Now it is a soft baked cookie but to me it was a tad bit dry. It was still edible and good. I will pick up a box once they are available.\n",
      " \n",
      "Got a free sample cookie from @influenster's Mom voxbox. These cookies are great they are soft and chewy and left me wanting more!\n",

      " \n",
      "I've always on the lookout for handy snacks for my teenage son.  he loves soft cookies, so I was thrilled to see the soft baked oatmeal cookie from the masters of oatmeal.  My expectations were high.<br /><br />This is a good cookie, but not a great one, so I was a little disappointed.  The consistency is excellent, just what you would want from a soft baked cookie.  And it is defintely enough for a snack - at 1.48 oz and 170 calories - that's plenty. The raisins, too were outstanding. But the cookie itself was not great tasting. I wanted bigger hunks of oatmeal-- more texture, and there was an aftertaste of the preservatives.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies may be the best oatmeal cookies you can eat that are not homemade.  They are well baked to the point had they spent another minute or two in the oven they may be burnt (which is exactly how I like my cookies).  And even though they are soft, they are firm enough they do not crumble in your hand.  And there is enough raisins you will have at least one or more in every bite.  On the flip side, the ingredient list is a bit lengthy with a few ingredients that I cannot pronounce (is a red flag for me).\n",
      " \n",
      "Nice flavor, and only 70 calories per cookie; the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are tasty.  But they're just not something to get overly excited about.  If oatmeal cookies are your definition of snacking nirvana, you might find these well worth trying.\n",
      " \n",
      "These cookies were a hit with everyone in our family from the oldest (35) to the youngest (17 months.)  The cookies were very soft and tasty.  Each cookie was full of raisins, and still retained an \"oatmeal\" taste.  They are sized perfectly, one cookie is big enough to satisfy a craving without eating half of the box.  My only complaint is that they were crumbly.  This was fine for my 17 month old twins, as they still don't have all of their teeth, and have trouble biting and chewing hard cookies.  I had a problem with the crumbly texture, because when I tried to dip the cookie into a glass of milk, a big chunk of it broke off and fell to the bottom of the glass, where it turned into inedible mush.  Aside from that one complaint, I have nothing bad to say about these yummy cookies.\n",
      " \n",
      "These are delicious, no question. They seem to have achieve the perfect level of sweetness, unlike most cookies with are a lot more sugary tasting. Kudos.<br /><br />There are also plenty of raisins, so at least part of its sweetness comes from a more natural source.<br /><br />My only complaint is the cookies were surprisingly dry. They are very well packaged, so I don't think that was the problem. Maybe they're made that way. But I've also heard that some products aren't great to order by mail in hot summer months, as they may dry out. I know mine probably spent at least a few hours on the porch in 90 degree weather. Dunking the cookie in tea or milk, or microwaving them for 15 seconds helped a lot.<br /><br />Otherwise, these were yummy and seem more healthy than other choices.\n",
      " \n",
      "These cookies are pretty good.  They are soft and flavorful.  They are not amazing or as good as homemade, but what packaged cookie is?  These are better than other packaged cookies we've tried, and the nutrition information isn't horrible either.\n",
      " \n",
      "These cookies are soft, but not crumbly like so many mass-produced \"soft\" cookies.  They have a good amount of raisins and slight oatmeal-spice flavor.  A plus is the individual wrappings, good for taking on an outing, packing in school lunches or even selling at a bake sale.  Don't expect the same chewiness or intensity of oat flavor as bakery or homemade cookies, but as store shelf cookies go, I've had worse (Chips Ahoy \"chewy gooey\" for instance).\n",
      " \n",
      "These are pretty tasteless, and the texture is all wrong.<br /><br />An oatmeal cookie should have a good texture, you should bite into something a little crunchy.  While I understand these are \"soft-baked\", I still expected to have some differentiation between the outer edges and the inside of the cookie.  There was none. They just don't taste that good.<br /><br />I ate one, my husband ate one, and the rest are still sitting in a box on the counter.\n",
      " \n",
      "I did not love the taste or texture of this cookie. It is somehow simultaneously soft and dry  and gritty. The taste is nothing remarkable. And, it is not particularly healthy- not bad, but the stats arent great for one small-ish cookie.<br /><br />Give it a try, you may like it, but I was disappointed. I recommend Bel Vita Biscuits as a healthier- and tastier- cookie alternative.\n",
      " \n",
      "For a product like this, it's pretty good. Soft, tasty, seemed fresh. They didn't last long at my house. I thought they were a bit too sweet, but the kids loved them. I'd rather eat home-made, but this is the next best thing.\n",
      " \n",
      "Quaker cookies have always been one of my favorites and these do not disapoint. These cookies are so delicious! They are soft and chewy and scrumptious. My kids love them, I love them, this is definitely on my shopping list :)\n",

I love them and most important my daughter loves them. These make the perfect snack for lunch, at day at the park or beach, or a midnight snack. Best part is they are healthy and don't make you feel bad for \"cheating\" a little on your diet. There's so much to say but to sum it all up....they are DELICIOUS!!!\n",

The plan was to give it to my husband who loves them. Well, before he could get it, my daughter snatched it up. She doesn't like raisins but loved this cookie!

      "I gave this product 4 stars because of it's usefulness to me. The kids LOVED it and they're not huge fans of oatmeal cookies! I thought it was tasty; however, I'm not likely to purchase it with frequency because I try to avoid packaged foods, and do not store a lot of sweets in the house for the kids. I would however choose this over the competition. (I got this product as a free trial from influenster.com)\n",

      "I received a quaker soft baked oatmeal raisin cookie from Influenster to try and review. I shared this with my son who does not like oatmeal and he loved it! I love that it is made with whole grains and could be a good substitute for an on the go breakfast when I am running behind. The flavoe is very good, I love the soft texture, I really don't care for hard cookies and this one is perfect. I would recomeend this product to others and will probably purchase some more for my family.\n",

After a few hours I thought well maybe I'll try it and it just happened to be the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookie, but the cookie was gone. My daughter just happened to \"go missing\" around the same time, and she's a mommy's girl and never leaves my side. So as I'm searching for her, I find her in my bathroom shower with the cookie almost ate up. I would have gave it to her anyway if she asked, but she hit it from me and ate it all herself! My daughter is extremely finicky when it comes to snacks, but this she gobbled right up. A cookie you can't go wrong with and good for them too!\n",

I took a bite and gave the rest to my son, which was gone before I even had a chance to change my mind. LOL One of the moistest, most delicious cookies I have ever had, hands down. The only drawback that I found was that my cookies was broken into about 5 pieces, not sure what happened, but that doesn't effect the flavor!\n",

And I grew up with a grandmother who always had fresh baked cookies in the kitchen. Having three kids of my own, of course I had to share with them. My son's comment on the cookie was, \"That's really yummy, Mommy!\" I am pretty sure we will be purchasing these in the future because my two boys keep asking if there is another cookie in my VoxBox.<br />I received a sample of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie with Raisins in my MomVoxBox from Influenster for review purposes only. All opinions are my own.\n",

Me and my son enjoyed our cookie with our lunch and it was a hit with both of us. It was such a soft and flavorful cookie that filled you up and left you satisfied. I will definitely be trying other varieties of the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies and will be recommending them to hall my friends!\n",

I wish I was able to try this with him, but I have celiac and am gluten free. However my one year old son gobbled it up. It was super soft and chewy. There were visible oats and lots of rasins. I like that they were healthy. I did not mind giving this for breakfast as a treat because they are quaker oats!\n",

      "I don't usually like Oatmeal Raisin cookies, but when Influenster sent me this cookie to try, I did, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved it! So great, so soft, and so delicious. I definitely recommend that everyone try this cookie.\n",

She did NOT want anyone to eat any of the cookies she says \"I's MINE!\" Even getting a new box \"It's mine\" have to hide it.  Thanks!! Annette G\n",
      " \n",
      "I know they say \"soft baked\" but how often is a packaged cookie really all that soft? Well, these are super soft!  The first thing I noticed when I opened the package was that the cookie was so soft and moist that it broke apart with little to no effort.  I shared the cookie with my preschool daughter.  We both loved the taste.  I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I really liked this cookie.  My daughter asked me to buy her more of them.  That in itself makes it a winner, ha!  These are great cookies and will become a staple in my pantry.\n",

      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins, is a great tasting snack that gives you that full feeling. Just 2 of these cookies gives you that satisfying full feeling. Since it is made out of oatmeal and raisins, we could classify it as a healthy snack. But on the nutritional breakdown, would be better if this snack would go down on a less than 5mg cholesterol. The per serving content of cholesterol is 15mg, sugar is 12g, so as with any other food, moderation is the key. Nevertheless, anything oatmeal gives you a great start on eating, whether to maintain a healthy lifestyle or starting one.\n",
      " \n",
      "Chewy, sweet goodness. These cookies are right up my alley. I even liked that they were individually packaged--great for lunch boxes or for keeping cookie monsters from devouring the entire package in one sitting. The individual cookies weren't huge but they were big and chewy enough to satisfy a sweet tooth with just one package. They weren't overly sweet or overloaded with raisins--someone must have studied the cookie-to-raisin ratio and came up with the perfect number. I'll definitely much on these again.\n",
      " \n",
      "This is an interesting product - the texture is immediately attractive and quite remarkable given that it is a packaged product, but the flavor is not quite right. There is a sense of artificiality about the flavor that may come from preservatives or flavoring additives. My family ate all the samples we received, but there was no real drive to go out and buy a box, even among my otherwise enthusiastic cookie-eating teens.  I think that the product needs a trip back to the drawing board if the goal is authentic oatmeal cookie taste and not just texture.  Sorry!\n",
      " \n",
      "As a lover of oatmeal cookies since the days of being a kid, I was anxious to try these from such a well known brand.  I have always been someone that sticks to either cheaper brands, or the kind of cookies that are made in a markets own bakery.  Personally I think the latter are the best there is in most cases as far as store bought is concerned..  As for these Quaker cookies I found them to be just average in taste.  The box I got held very fresh cookies individually wrapped that were satisfying in flavor, but not at all anything special.  Personally I don't think the heavier cost of these are worth it for just being a famous brand.  You can do at least just as good with other store bought brands, and much better in my opinion in buying your local markets cookies.  On the other hand if you happen to be a big fan Quaker Oats cookies, or just enjoy the particular flavor of these, buying them here in the big 12 pack is not a bad deal at all.  The cost is enough to get you the free shipping, and the convenience along with the reasonable price makes it a sold deal.  Enjoy if these are your favor.. : )\n",
      " \n",
      "Quaker soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins taste pretty darn good. The only draw back are they're too dry. Still, much better than many other similar cookies made by other companies, some who make their products even drier and why sweeter. Still, with a cup of tea or coffee they make a pretty good snack or bit of an after dinner treat. I was disappointed when I reached into the box for a cookie after lunch and realized I'd already eaten them all!\n",
      " \n",
      "I'm always on the look-out for a good tasting, individually wrapped, healthy snack that I can toss in my bag for a quick bite. Oatmeal cookies are one of my favorites so I gave these a try.<br /><br />The packaging is fine but the cookie does not have a very good taste. It has a dry texture to it, not very oat-like at all. They are soft, but not moist. There were plenty of raisens but not enough spice for my taste. On the positive side, they do contain more fiber than most cookies, but at 170 calories each, they are a little fattening.\n",
      " \n",
      "I tried one: gave it two bites (to be sure) and then into the trash. Not even close to appetizing. It's amazing, how can something be chewy and yet powdery dry and quite tasteless simultaneously? Quaker's R&D figured out the conundrum and produced these \"cookies\". I assume it's the oat bran since I had similar experiences with using it when it was THE thing to do (e.g., pancakes). However, what ever it is, it ain't good! I do not recommend these, not even to my sworn enemies!\n",
      " \n",
      "This is a pretty good cookie in terms of taste / flavor, but as cookies go I will say it was a little dry with the actual cookie part and not as moist as I like with oatmeal cookies (the raisins were moist).  Each cookie is individually wrapped vs. opening up a whole box which makes for a good snack to take the edge off of your day.<br /><br />Each cookie is 170 calories with 6 grams of fat (9% of recommended daily value) and 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the recommended daily value), so I really don't want to eat more than one a day!\n",
      " \n",
      "First of all, I like that the cookies are individually wrapped. I can grab one and stick it in my pocket on my way out the door in the morning.<br /><br />The cookies themselves are big and a good thickness. They are soft with out being crumbly. The promised raisins are mostly small bits of chopped raisins and don't really add to the flavor of the cookie. I would have like whole raisins. The taste is mostly oatmeal with just the right amount of cinnamon. They are also dry. You really need an accompanying beverage with these. They are hearty enough that one makes a good snack.<br /><br />While I would never mistake these for Mom's oatmeal cookies (or mine for that matter) they're not too bad for \"store-bought.\" If you like oatmeal cookies, give these a try. Just have a drink ready, too.\n",
      " \n",
      "I am kind of shocked that these cookies were too sweet since I have really enjoyed how Quaker can make food be sweet but not too sweet. These are all individually wrapped, which is easy for on the go and keeps the cookies extra fresh. Each cookie is a decent size and we ate these over a week and it kept its softness.<br /><br />For me, it was a bit too sweet and I am a big sweet eater. I actually don't taste the oatmeal as much and more of the raisins, which could be why it was just so sweet to me.<br /><br />It was still yummy and I would get it again but only if I am in a really sweet mood.\n",

I was a little apprehensive giving the cookie to my own two \"cookie monsters\" because they have not been big raisin fans, but they LOVED it!  The texture is so soft and chewy that they gobbled it up and asked for more!  They never even noticed the raisins!  I will buy these again as a special treat for them :)\n",

      "Quaker Soft Baked cookie taste homemade, I like that is made with whole grains, low calorie & just healthy yummy goodness that everyone in the family can enjoy. I feel good about buying this because the ingredients are simple & I have used Quaker for years. Is a much better alternative than the other regular cookies you see in the store. Packed with raisins & whole grains. Great to pack, on road trips or just in your purse. Kid tested and approved!

      "I really loved this cookie. The calories in it are not bad and the taste is great. I am always looking for a quick on the go breakfast and this hits the nail on the head. It would go amazingly with a cup of coffee. The cookie was soft and full of flavor. The only thing that I didn't love was it kind of had a salty after taste. If the sodium could be reduced just a smidgen then it would be the best cookie I have ever tasted. I would buy these if our commissary would carry them!\n",

      "I got a free sample via influenster, I'm not gonna lie the Quaker cookie was the first thing that caught my eye. First of its was so soft & chewy its just melts in your mouth. I definetly stocked up on the cookies. I tried the oatmeal cookie & its still my fav!!\n",

      "I really liked this cookie. It was very soft and chewy just how I like my cookies. The only problem was it could have been sweeter, maybe with some chocolate chips in with the raisins it would have been even better. I think for a quick breakfast great choice, not so much as a sweet though.\n",

They are so soft and tasty, even my 8 year loved this cookie and she hates oatmeal. I highly recommend these cookies.

      " \n",
      "I received the Raisin flavored from Influenster complimentary for tasting.  It was very good to me, not too sweet and not oily tasting like some package cookies. The fact that it is made with whole grain oats made it even better.  I am going to buy the cranberry & yogurt next.\n",

Quaker oats been around since over a hundred years.\n",

      "These cookies are a great cookie. I love oatmeal cookies but the only thing I didn't like was the raisins. This is only because I hate raisins. So if you like raisins then you would probably like them. I probably wouldn't repurchase this for myself because I would rather make homemade without them. I would repurchase it for my boyfriend though because he loves raisins.\n",

One for myself, one for my husband, and another for our 1 1/2 year old daughter.<br />Our daughter devoured the cookie before I even sat back down and was asking for more. She absolutely loved it. My husband and I, on the other hand, were not impressed. We were expecting something a little more. The cookie itself was a little dry and there was something about the taste that was off a little bit.<br /><br />I do not think we will be buying this product in our home in the future. But I am pleasantly pleased with the chance to try it first.\n",

They taste just like homeade cookies. They are soft , full of raisins, and are just fabulous.I bought a box at my locl Walmart the other day for $2.18 for eight cookies. These are a good size cookie too. Iwll be back to buy mor of them for sure thanks to the wonderful ingredients from Quaker I can't wait to try out the different varieties that Quaker carries! A fan for life I am!!Thanks Quaker!! Thanks to Influenster for giving me the chance to try these cookies in my Vox Box! They were A+++.\n",

      " \n",
      "I received one of these cookies in my Influenster Mom VoxBox, these cookies, are really good and soft and chewy! I really enjoyed it! It tasted fresh, and not at all like a packaged cookie, I was also impressed at how well it held together during shipping, it was not crumbly like other cookies that have arrived in the mail.\n",
      " \n",
      "These individually wrapped cookies taste fairly good. A little on the bland side, but the good side of the bland side, if there is such a thing. They are a nice sized cookie...bigger than other packaged cookies that come in the plastic trays. They have the perfect amount of raisins in them - not over packed, but just enough. I guess I expected them to be more \"oatmealy\" since they are from Quaker, after all. They have the oatmeal raisin cookie flavor going on, but not the texture.<br /><br />The complaint that I have with them is that they are SO very dry. You will definitely want to have a big glass of milk handy. That itself was another problem for me - I don't drink milk. I just don't like it. Yes, it is a personal problem, not a fault of Quaker of course, but what else do you drink with cookies? Nothing else seems to go quite right with cookies. I do like to dunk cookies in milk, but these Oatmeal Raisin cookies are not a good choice for that because they would get mushy and fall apart right away.<br /><br />I can't say that i'd buy these. Much too dry for me and not enough flavor to make up for it.\n",
      " \n",
      "Came as an 8-pack, individually wrapped.  Bottom line- they're awesome!  Soft, chewy, about 1/4 inch thick and full of oatmeal-raisiny goodness, you can't go wrong with these!  Soooo good!\n",
      " \n",
      "Look, it's simple.  You want a good oatmeal raisin cookie, you bake them yourself or go to a bakery.  Stuff you get out of a box like this will never come close.  That said, for what this is, it's not bad.  At 3 in the morning when you're having a cookie emergency, they'll do just fine with a glass of milk or a cup of tea.  But don't expect a lot of home-baked flavor, or even the kind of moist chewiness you think of when you think of an oatmeal cookie because it's simply not there.<br /><br />I can't really recommend them, but I can't entirely dismiss them either.  Consider them stop-gap and buy accordingly.\n",
      " \n",
      "Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite type of cookie. My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies and a lady at church makes the second best. However, I'm always willing to try someone else's oatmeal raisin cookies. Recently, Quaker started selling these SOFT-BAKED OATMEAL COOKIE WITH RAISINS. The cookies themselves aren't too bad. They're better than the usual store-bought oatmeal cookie. They're soft and chewy with a slightly sweet aftertaste. However, there's nothing that really distinguishes them either. There are 6 cookies in a box. They are good cookies that make a nice after lunch dessert or an in between snack.\n",
      " \n",
      "Who doesn't love oatmeal cookies made with Quaker Oats? I have many fond memories of enjoying making cookies straight out of the Quaker oat box, enjoying them after-school or having them packed in my school lunchbag. When I saw these were available to test, I was naturally excited, I've always loved Quaker oats and they make a quality product. Always.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found these cookies to be remarkably bland and quite plain. They aren't sweet enough for my particular taste, nor are they remarkable in any way. Sure they have whole grain. But they taste too bland for me, and are indeed quite plain. No one in my family liked them. They were just completely generic. For me, they needed more cinnamon and sugar and vanilla for my taste preference.<br /><br />There are 6 individual cookies sealed in tiny packs, making them useful for travel/lunches.\n",
      " \n",
      "I love oatmeal cookies, so I was really enthused about giving a new brand a try. However, these failed miserably in my mind - each individual cookie has 12g of sugar, yet there is a dry, bland taste. Combined with the fact that there are 170 calories, 6 grams of fat and 150 mg of sodium in each cookie, it's hardly worth eating if you don't even enjoy the taste!\n",
      " \n",
      "As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again.\n",
      " \n",
      "I hardly noticed the raisins in this cookie, which is great if you don't like raisins, but I do like them.  The oatmeal flavor for the cookie is just as it should be.  When first opening the packet the aroma hinted at maybe a pinch of cinnamon added or maybe nutmeg in the mix.<br /><br />The consistency though was spongy, and rather dry.  I needed something to drink with it to help moisten it up.\n",
      " \n",
      "I was impressed with the list of ingredients that included whole grain oat and whole grain wheat flour as well as whole grain rolled oats. Most cookies labeled \"oatmeal\" have enriched white flour as their main ingredient.  These cookies also have a generous amount of juicy raisins, not the dried out raisins found in some other brands.<br /><br />I did find the cookies a bit too sweet for my taste, especially on the first bite.  The sweetness was much less strong after that first bite. There is a natural grain aftertaste that I found pleasant but others may not.  Also, I found the cookies a bit too crumbly when the individual packs are first opened. I found that if I let the opened package sit in a sealed contained for a day or two the texture was more to my liking.<br /><br />I liked the individual packages so that you can eat just one without the rest going stale.  I also liked that the ingredient list is on each package; this is very important for those with food allergies if the box is not available.<br /><br />All in all though these are a good treat. Very enjoyable.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that rating were possible.\n",
      " \n",
      "If you're thin & can eat cookies, enjoy yourself.  These come in single packs of mid-sized cookies (.73 oz. each), so I suppose it can help with portion control.  However, at 170 calories, it's pretty high for those needing to lose weight.  It only contains 2g of protein.  It also contains 12g of sugar, so I wouldn't call this a friendly treat for those people battling diabetes or who are borderline diabetics.  The ingredients are in very tiny print, in a box that is over 1.5 inches in length, & contains loads of ingredients I can barely pronounce & have no idea what they are.  It's is kinda soft & tastes okay; but it's not a cookie a foodie like myself gushes over.\n",

      "I didn't expect a lot from a pre-packaged cookie, but I was pleasantly surprised by the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin!  It was surprisingly soft and chewy.  I also love that it's a somewhat healthy snack.  It would be even better warmed up in the microwave for a few seconds.  Good job, Quaker :)<br /><br />I received this product complimentary for testing purposes through the Influenster Mom VoxBox.\n",

I'm an on-the-go mom and it's easy to grab this to eat for breakfast or as a snack any time of day.  The cookie is a good size and it is moist and yummy.

      "I received a sample of this product for free to test from Influenster and Quaker.  The cookie did not last long and I ended up going out to buy a whole new box.<br /><br />My son is three and he said the cookie tasted \"kind of like a muffin\" and wanted to know if he could have one for breakfast the next day.  The cookie is very soft and the flavor is nice.  It tastes great with a big glass of milk or microwaved for 10 seconds or so to heat it up.  The individually wrapped cookies make them great to pack in lunches or keep in the car for an afternoon snack.  Truthfully, if they weren't individually wrapped, you could probably eat several in one sitting without even realizing it.<br /><br />Go ahead and plate them up and say you cooked them yourself.  They are pretty great!  Oh, and they're not bad nutritionally... so go ahead and eat one for breakfast... I won't tell.\n",

It was delicious and soft baked, just like home made cookies.  My only complaint is that my cookie didn't have a good amount of raisins in it.  Maybe I just got a batch that missed a few extra raisins but I definitely felt that it could've used more.  Other than that, it was a great snack, especially to serve to kids!!  I can't wait to try the other flavors :)\n",

I was able to steal a small amount from her...It was so yummy and soft.  It was a nice size too. It was not small at all and you will get your moneys worth.  The fact that it has oatmeal is a plus, meaning my kids are putting something healthy in them when they are snacking.  I will definetely buy this product again and will recommend it to anyone.  If you want a yummy soft cookie with lots of flavor with none of the work and clean up after baking...go get a box of Soft Bake Quaker Oatmeal Cookies...you won't be sorry. :-) I know my kids are happy that I tryed it....Thanks again Influenster and Quaker.\n",

They are individually packaged, so they are great for on the go! They are made with yummy whole grain Quaker oats! They are a good source of fiber and only have 6 grams of total fat per serving! I know you are dying to know where you can get these now! You can buy them at pretty much any major retailers and have a suggested retail of $2.69 for 6 cookies, That's less than $0.50 a cookie! Great deal! Give them a try and let me know how you like tem!\n",

I would definitely recommend these cookies if you love oatmeal rasin cookies.\n",

All they had were the Apple Cinnamon ones and he ate the entire box! I luckily put up 1 cookie just in case and that was my cookie. Hubby and him are addicted and I can see why.

      "Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with Raisins are OK, but they left me wanting something better.  I thought they tasted good, but I found them to be a little on the dry side.  A lot of packaged cookies have an odd chemical aftertaste, but I didn't really notice much with these.<br /><br />However, I would like to see better choices on ingredients.  First, I don't understand the need for both bleached and unbleached flour.  Quaker should just stick with unbleached.  Second, I accept sugar as an ingredient.  These are cookies.  Cookies are sweet, and I expect sugar.  Yet why do they also have to use fructose, invert sugar syrup, corn syrup, and polydextrose?  These also contain molasses, which are a natural sweetener.  Finally, these have both corn starch and modified corn starch.  Again, why?  You may find other ingredients that you would question, but these seemed like the glaring issues to me.  In the end, I think this is too much to overcome when you combine it with a relatively high percentage (60 out of 170) of calories from fat.  In short, I cannot recommend these cookies.\n",
      " \n",
      "I received one box of these cookies from the Amazon Vine program. I had not done any rsearch on them previously but remembered the oatmeal cookies my grandmother baked and how tasty they were. I was anxious to try out the Quaker version. When the box arrived the first thing I noticed, right on the front of the box, was that each of the six individually wrapped cookies contains a whopping 170 calories. When I was a super active kid I ate my grandmother's cookies with impunity although I did not know the calorie count. I was always a skinny kid regardless of what I ate. Now, as an adult, I am no longer skinny but not a lard butt either and I do not aspire to become one by eating these cookies. However, I wanted to do a taste test so I took a bite and quickly realized that these are simply run of the mill oatmeal cookies. They have no distinguishing characteristics other than the major calorie count. Dry, stale and tasteless are the best descriptions I can come up with.\n",
      " \n",
      "I received a box of these cookies through the Amazon Vine program, and I am not impressed.  I had rather high expectations since I generally like Quaker products, and my family eats a lot of their chewy granola bars. These cookies are quite disappointing. They are soft, but they are also very dry. The raisins are totally desiccated and not even chewy because they are so dry and shriveled. The cookies themselves have a dry, rather powdery texture. At 170 calories per cookie, I plan to stick with Quaker's chewy granola bars which taste much better and are in the 90-110 calorie range.\n",
      " \n",
      "When it has came down to Quaker, they have really made some great products for snacking along the busy day. From their classic granola bars, to instant oatmeal on the go. But they have decided to step that up again with their soft baked oatmeal cookies. They absolutely taste very good. The feeling of being a simple cookie are worth their while. My only gripes about them is that their only 6 in a package so if you really are a heavy cookie snacker, you'll be a bit dissapointed. Also, there aren't that many in a package compared to the amount there are in a box from Little Debbie or other brands of cookies. Nevertheless, they are definitely delightful from Quaker, and if you're looking for a alternative to cookies, than this would be a good box to try.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+\n",
      " \n",
      "I am a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, and enjoy eating them for a snack or dessert. These are very good pre-made soft oatmeal-raisin cookies, and I have really enjoyed eating them. They are soft, chewy and they taste great. They are not too bad when it comes to nutrition either - each one of them is just 170 calories. The only downside for me about these cookies is that they seem to be a bit too crumbly, and not gooey enough. Each cookie comes in an individual wrapping, so tehy are very convenient to take with you for a snack on a go, and the individual wrapping also helps preserve freshness. Overall, a very good choice for fulfilling your sweet cravings.\n",
      " \n",
      "The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Raisins have very good packaging, one relatively sturdy outside box and individually wrapped cookies inside. This is the high point. It goes down hill from there.<br /><br />Let me start with the taste. It is average at best, it is soft, but very cardboardy in taste which makes the sweetness of the raisins stand out even more. Often times with food, the trade-offs are great taste with bad nutrition versus average/bad taste with good nutrition. This one has both average/bad taste and bad nutrition. So what's the point of eating not-very-tasty junk food?<br /><br />Because let's face it, that's what this is. The list of ingredients is unnaturally long - 16 lines (yes sixteen lines) of ingredients on the box, including fan favorite Corn Syrup. This is just an oatmeal cookie for crying out loud.<br /><br />And here's the bad nutrition: 170 calories per cookie, including 5% cholesterol, 12g sugars, 6% sodium (150mg). On the plus side, 4g of dietary fiber and 2g of protein. Other numbers from the label: 6g of fat (1.5g saturated), 27g total carbs, and single digit percentages of iron and calcium. Each cookie weighs around 1.5 ounces, so this is not a giant cookie.<br /><br />If you are going to eat a cookie, at least eat a cookie you actually like. Otherwise, what's the point?\n",

      "Let me start off by saying I'm a bit of a cookie snob having lived next door to my grandmother for most of my youth.  There's nothing better than a homemade cookie.  Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.\n",

      "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 4:14 Mins<br /><br /></span>These are very good, not too sweet, not too crumbly, slightly dry, good raisins with low ratio, excellent texture, very natural tasting (nothing artificial), dense & filling enough.  For a store bought cookie, they are very good.  There is nothing artificial tasting to them, they stay soft, but have a good chewy texture that holds together well.  They taste a little dry, but are not dried out or too brittle.  Most home made cookies dry out and turn brittle on me in a few days.  These hold up well.  The raising ratio seems just right, not too many but a very good balance of sweetness & wetness in the right places.  They are moderately sized, smaller that I would have guessed from the large picture and size on the box, but seemed filling enough because they were sufficiently dense.  They are not perfection compared to actual home baking fresh out of the oven, but relative to store bought cookies, and other oatmeal cookies, I thought they were very good.<br /><br />One thing to remember is that these are not as healthy as implied by all the good things promoted about using Quaker oats and being a good source of fiber.  They do have 16% fiber and pack in other good things, but they do carry 9% of your daily value of fat too, per cookie.  Compared to other cookies or snacks which offer no positives, these pack in good things along with the bad.  Just don't think consider them as good as just eating an apple without any fat.  But if the alternative is to pick up potato chips or other cookies, these at least pack in health benefits if you are going to eat such a snack anyway.\n",

      "I received Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in Raisin complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.<br /><br />I have an off again on again relationship with oatmeal cookies because some oatmeal cookies have a very gritty texture from the oatmeal. I was pleasantly surprised that the pieces of cookie I tested were not very gritty, and the raisin was delicious. There is NO WAY these were not homemade in some shape or fashion. They are so delicious.<br /><br />With only 6 grams of fat,170 calories, and 12g of sugar per serving (1 cookie) I would consider it a healthier alternative to other cookies on the market. I've already went to the store and purchased another box.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in trying these cookies out!\n",

       "'Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies with raisins are a delicious treat, great for anytime of day.  For example:<br /><br />--at breakfast, I had one with a large banana and a cup of coffee, and felt I\\'d had a relatively \"healthy\" start to the day.<br /><br />--the next day at lunch, following a tuna sandwich, I had one with a glass of milk, and was satisfied enough to not need a snack before dinner at 6:30.<br /><br />--the following night, after dinner, I had one with the remainder of my glass of wine. (Delicious!) And again, didn\\'t feel the need to snack later in the evening.<br /><br />Each cookie is individually packaged, and their texture is soft and moist, with just the right amount of sweetness. Natural flavors used in the making are Cinnamon and All Spice.  These flavorings give the cookies a real old-fashioned, homemade taste.<br /><br />Nutritionally, the cookies have 170 calories each, 1.5g saturated fat, 150 mg sodium, and 12g sugar. They also have 2g of protein, and contain 25g of fiber.<br /><br />While the calorie count may seem a bit high for one cookie, they are good sized, and 1 cookie per serving is certainly enough to satisfy.<br /><br />Because of their great taste and texture, kids will probably enjoy them also.<br /><br />If you like oatmeal raisin cookies, give these a try!'"
