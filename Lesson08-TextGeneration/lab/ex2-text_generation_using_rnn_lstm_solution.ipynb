    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generation is a challenging problem that even the largest data science teams are still struggling with, so we'll explore some of the most common and accessible methods to solve the problem, starting at a somewhat basic level. The approach we will attempt in this notebook is:\n",

    "* Character and word based RNN using the library textgenrnn\n",
    "\n",
    "textgenrnn is a Python module on top of Keras/TensorFlow which can easily generate text using a pretrained recurrent neural network: textgenrnn is a project by Max Woolf (https://github/minimaxir/textgenrnn)         "

    "#### Train a new model\n",
    "You can train a new model using any modern RNN architecture you want by:\n",
    "* calling train_new_model if supplying texts, or adding a new_model=True parameter if training from a file. If you do, the model will save a config file and a vocab file in addition to the weights, and those must be also loaded into a textgenrnn instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The config parameters available are:\n",
    "* word_level: Whether to train the model at the word level (default: False)\n",
    "* rnn_layers: Number of recurrent LSTM layers in the model (default: 2)\n",
    "* rnn_size: Number of cells in each LSTM layer (default: 128)\n",
    "* rnn_bidirectional: Whether to use Bidirectional LSTMs, which account for sequences both forwards and backwards. Recommended if the input text follows a specific schema. (default: False)\n",
    "* max_length: Maximum number of previous characters/words to use before predicting the next token. This value should be reduced for word-level models (default: 40)\n",
    "* max_words: Maximum number of words (by frequency) to consider for training (default: 10000)\n",
    "* dim_embeddings: Dimensionality of the character/word embeddings (default: 100)\n",
