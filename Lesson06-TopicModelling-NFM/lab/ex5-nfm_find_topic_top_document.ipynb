    "Topic modelling aims to automatically discover the hidden thematic structure in a large corpus of text documents. One approach for topic modelling is to apply *matrix factorisation* methods, such as *Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF)*. In this notebook we look at how to apply NMF using the *scikit-learn* library in Python."
